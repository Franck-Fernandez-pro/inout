# create-expo-app

A command-line tool to create a new Expo and React Native project.

`create-expo-app` is a command-line tool to create and set up a new Expo and React Native project. This tool simplifies the initialization process by providing various templates to get started quickly without the need for manual configuration.

## Create a new project

To create a new project, run the following command:

```sh
# npm
npx create-expo-app@latest --template default@sdk-55

# yarn
yarn create expo-app --template default@sdk-55

# pnpm
pnpm create expo-app --template default@sdk-55

# bun
bun create expo --template default@sdk-55
```

> **Note:** During the SDK 55 transition period, `create-expo-app@latest` without the `--template` flag creates an SDK 54 project. If you plan to use Expo Go on a physical device, use an SDK 54 project. Otherwise, use `--template default@sdk-55` to create an SDK 55 project.

Running the above command will prompt you to enter the app name of your project. This app name is also used in the app config's [`name`](/versions/latest/config/app#name) property.

```sh
What is your app named? my-app
```

## Options

Uses the following options to customize the command behavior.

### `--yes`

Uses the default options to create a new project.

### `--no-install`

Skips installing npm dependencies or CocoaPods.

### `--template`

Running `create-expo-app` with a [Node Package Manager](/more/create-expo#node-package-managers-support) initializes and sets up a new Expo project using the default template.

You can use the `--template` option to select one of the following templates or pass it as an argument to the option. For example, `--template default`.

> Looking for more templates? Check out the [`--example`](/more/create-expo#--example) option to initialize your project with one of the example apps that demonstrate specific features and integrations.

| Template | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`default`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/templates/expo-template-default) | Default template. Designed to build multi-screen apps. Includes recommended tools such as Expo CLI, Expo Router library and TypeScript configuration enabled. Suitable for most apps. |
| [`blank`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/templates/expo-template-blank) | Installs minimum required npm dependencies without configuring navigation. |
| [`blank-typescript`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/templates/expo-template-blank-typescript) | A Blank template with TypeScript enabled. |
| [`tabs`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/templates/expo-template-tabs) | Installs and configures file-based routing with Expo Router and TypeScript enabled. |
| [`bare-minimum`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/templates/expo-template-bare-minimum) | A Blank template with native directories (**android** and **ios**) generated. Runs [`npx expo prebuild`](/workflow/prebuild) during the setup. |

### `--example`

Use this option to initialize a project using an example from [expo/examples](https://github.com/expo/examples).

For example:

-   Running `npx create-expo-app --example with-router` sets up a project with the Expo Router library
-   Running `npx create-expo-app --example with-react-navigation` sets up a project similar to the default template, but configured with plain React Navigation library

### `--version`

Prints the version number and exits.

### `--help`

Prints the list of available options and exits.

## Node Package Managers support

Creating a new project with `create-expo-app` also handles setting up additional configuration needed for a specific Node Package Manager.

**If you are migrating from one package manager to another**, you've to manually carry out the additional configuration in your project. **If you are using [EAS](/eas)**, you also have to configure your project for any additional required steps manually.

All the additional steps for each package manager are listed below.

### npm

#### Local installation

npm is installed as part of Node.js installation. See [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for installation instructions.

#### EAS installation

Supported by default if the project directory contains **package-lock.json**.

### Yarn 1 (Classic)

#### Local installation

Yarn 1 (Classic) is usually installed as a global dependency of npm. See [Yarn 1 documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started) for installation instructions.

#### EAS installation

Supported by default if the project directory contains **yarn.lock**.

### Yarn 2+ (Modern)

#### Local installation

See [Yarn documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) for installation instructions.

Yarn 2+ handles package management differently than Yarn 1. One of the core changes in Yarn 2+ is the [Plug'n'Play (PnP)](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) node linking model that does not work with React Native.

By default, a project created with `create-expo-app` and Yarn 2+ uses [`nodeLinker`](https://yarnpkg.com/features/linkers#nodelinker-node-modules) with its value set to `node-modules` to install dependencies.

```yaml
nodeLinker: node-modules
```

#### EAS installation

Yarn Modern on EAS requires adding [`eas-build-pre-install` hook](/build-reference/npm-hooks). In your project's **package.json**, add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "eas-build-pre-install": "corepack enable && yarn set version 4"
  }
}
```

### pnpm

#### Local installation

Requires installing Node.js. See [pnpm documentation](https://pnpm.io/installation) for installation instructions.

By default, a project created with `create-expo-app` and pnpm uses [`node-linker`](https://pnpm.io/npmrc#node-linker) with its value set to `hoisted` to install dependencies.

```ini
node-linker=hoisted
```

> In **SDK 54** and later, Expo supports isolated installations, and you can delete the `node-linker` setting if you prefer to use isolated dependencies.

#### EAS installation

Supported by default if the project directory contains **pnpm-lock.yaml**.

### Bun

See [Bun](/guides/using-bun) guide for details on creating a new Expo project with `bun`, migration from another package manager, and usage with EAS.

# Expo CLI

The Expo CLI is a command-line tool that is the primary interface between a developer and other Expo tools.

The `expo` package provides a small and powerful CLI tool `npx expo` which is designed to keep you moving fast during app development.

## Highlights

-   [Start a server](/more/expo-cli#develop) for developing your app: `npx expo start`.
-   [Generate the native Android and iOS directories](/more/expo-cli#prebuild) for your project: `npx expo prebuild`.
-   [Build and run](/more/expo-cli#compiling) the native apps locally: `npx expo run:ios` and `npx expo run:android`.
-   [Install and update packages](/more/expo-cli#install) that work with the version of `react-native` in your project: `npx expo install package-name`.
-   `npx expo` can be used with `npx react-native` simultaneously.

To view a list of available commands in Expo CLI, run the following in your project:

```sh
npx expo -h
```

> You can also run `yarn expo -h` if you prefer to use yarn as the package manager.

The output should look something like below:

```sh
Usage
  $ npx expo <command>

Commands
  start, export
  run:ios, run:android, prebuild
  install, customize, config
  login, logout, whoami, register

Options
  --version, -v   Version number
  --help, -h      Usage info
```

You can run any command with the `--help` or `-h` flag to learn more about it:

```sh
npx expo login -h
```

## Installation

Expo CLI is included in the `expo` package. You can install it with npm or yarn:

```sh
yarn add expo
```

> Projects that are not using [Expo Prebuild](/more/expo-cli#prebuild) (also referred to as _Bare projects_) will need to perform additional setup to ensure all custom Expo bundling features work: [Metro: Bare workflow setup](/versions/latest/config/metro#bare-workflow-setup).

## Develop

Start a development server to work on your project by running:

```sh
npx expo start
```

> You can also run `npx expo` as an alias to `npx expo start`.

This command starts a server on `http://localhost:8081` that a client can use to interact with the bundler. The default bundler is [Metro](https://metrobundler.dev/).

The UI that shows up in the process is referred to as the **Terminal UI**. It contains a QR code (for the dev server URL) and a list of keyboard shortcuts you can press:

| Keyboard shortcut | Description |
| --- | --- |
| A | Open the project on a connected Android device. |
| Shift + A | Select an Android device or emulator to open. |
| I | Open the project in an iOS Simulator. |
| Shift + I | Select an iOS Simulator to open. |
| W | Open the project in a web browser. This may require webpack to be installed in your project. |
| R | Reload the app on any connected device. |
| S | Switch the launch target between Expo Go and development builds. |
| M | Open the dev menu on any connected native device (web not supported). |
| Shift + M | Choose more commands to trigger on connected devices.This includes toggling the performance monitor, opening the element inspector, reloading the device, and opening the dev menu. |
| J | Open React Native DevTools for any connected device that is using Hermes as the JavaScript engine. [Learn more](/guides/using-hermes#javascript-inspector-for-hermes). |
| O | Open project code in your editor. This can be configured with the `EXPO_EDITOR` and `EDITOR` [environment variables](/more/expo-cli#environment-variables). |
| E | Show the development server URL as a QR code in the terminal. |
| ? | Show all Terminal UI commands. |

### Launch target

The `npx expo start` command automatically launches the app in a development build if `expo-dev-client` is installed in the project. Otherwise, it launches the app in Expo Go.

Alternatively, you can force the launch target by passing the following flags to the command:

-   `--dev-client`: Always launch the app in a development build.
-   `--go`: Always launch the app in Expo Go.

You can also switch the launch target during runtime by pressing S in the **Terminal UI**. The `run` commands also use `--dev-client` after compiling the development build, by default.

### Server URL

By default, the project is served over a LAN connection. You can change this behavior to localhost-only by using the flag `npx expo start --localhost`.

Other available options are:

-   `--port`: Port to start the dev server on (does not apply to webpack or [tunnel URLs](/more/expo-cli#tunneling)). Use `--port 0` to automatically use the first available port. Default: **8081**.
-   `--https`: **(Deprecated in favor of `--tunnel`)** Start the dev server using a secure origin. This is currently only supported on web.

You can force the URL to be any value with the `EXPO_PACKAGER_PROXY_URL` environment variable. For example:

```sh
export EXPO_PACKAGER_PROXY_URL=http://expo.dev
npx expo start
```

Will open apps to: `exp://expo.dev:80` (the `:80` is a temporary workaround for Android WebSockets).

#### Tunneling

Restrictive network conditions (common for public Wi-Fi), firewalls (common for Windows users), or Emulator misconfiguration can make it difficult to connect a remote device to your dev server over lan/localhost.

Sometimes it's easier to connect to a dev server over a proxy URL that's accessible from any device with internet access, this is referred to as **tunneling**. `npx expo start` provides built-in support for **tunneling** via [ngrok](https://ngrok.com).

To enable tunneling, first install `@expo/ngrok`:

```sh
npm i -g @expo/ngrok
```

Then run the following to start your dev server from a _tunnel_ URL:

```sh
npx expo start --tunnel
```

This will serve your app from a public URL like: `https://xxxxxxx.bacon.19000.exp.direct:80`.

Use the `EXPO_TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN` environment variable to experimentally set the subdomain for the tunnel URL. This is useful for testing universal links on iOS. This may cause unexpected issues with `expo-linking` and Expo Go. Select the exact subdomain to use by passing a `string` value that is not one of: `true`, `false`, `1`, `0`.

**Drawbacks**

-   Tunneling is slower than local connections because requests must be forwarded to a public URL.
-   Tunnel URLs are public and can be accessed by any device with a network connection. Expo CLI mitigates the risk of exposure by adding entropy to the beginning of the URL. Entropy can be reset by clearing the **.expo** directory in your project.
-   Tunnels require a network connection on both devices, meaning this feature cannot be used with the `--offline` flag.

Tunneling requires a third-party hosting service, this means it may sometimes experience intermittent issues like `ngrok tunnel took too long to connect` or `Tunnel connection has been closed. This is often related to intermittent connection problems with the Ngrok servers...`. Be sure to check for [Ngrok outages](https://status.ngrok.com/) before reporting an issue. Some Windows users have also reported needing to modify their antivirus settings to allow Ngrok to work correctly.

#### Offline

You can develop without a network connection by using the `--offline` flag:

```sh
npx expo start --offline
```

Offline will prevent the CLI from making network requests. If you don't use the flag and your computer has no internet connection, then offline support will automatically be enabled, it will just take a bit longer to verify the reachability.

Expo CLI makes network requests to sign manifests with your user credentials to ensure sensitive information is sandboxed in reusable runtimes like Expo Go.

### .expo directory

When you start the development server in a project for the first time, a **.expo** directory is created at the root of that project. It contains two files:

-   **devices.json**: Contains information about devices that have opened this project recently.
-   **settings.json**: Contains information about server configuration that is used to serve the project's manifest.

Both of these files have information that is specific to your local computer. This is the reason why **.expo** directory is included in the **.gitignore** file, by default, when a new project is created. It is not meant to be shared with other developers.

## Building

A React Native app consists of two parts: a native runtime ([compiling](/more/expo-cli#compiling)), and static files like JavaScript bundles and assets ([exporting](/more/expo-cli#exporting)). Expo CLI provides commands for performing both tasks.

### Compiling

You can compile your app locally with the `run` commands:

```sh
npx expo run:ios
npx expo run:android
```

**Highlights**

-   Build directly on connected devices with no global side effects using the `--device` flag. Supports locked devices, letting you retry instantly instead of needing to rebuild.
-   Automatically codesign iOS apps for development from the CLI without having to open Xcode.
-   Smart log parsing shows warnings and errors from your project source code, unlike Xcode which surfaces hundreds of benign warnings from your node modules.
-   Fatal errors causing your app to crash will be surfaced in the terminal preventing the need to reproduce in Xcode.

`npx expo run:ios` can only be run on a Mac, and Xcode must be installed. You can build the app in the cloud from any computer using `eas build -p ios`. Similarly, `npx expo run:android` requires Android Studio and Java to be installed and configured on your computer.

Building locally is useful for developing native modules and [debugging complex native issues](/debugging/runtime-issues#native-debugging). Building remotely with `eas build` is a much more resilient option due to the pre-configured cloud environment.

If your project does not have the corresponding native directories, the `npx expo prebuild` command will run once to generate the respective directory before building.

For example, if your project does not have an **ios** directory in the root of your project, then `npx expo run:ios` will first run `npx expo prebuild -p ios` before compiling your app. For more information on this process, see [Expo Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild).

**Cross-platform arguments**

-   `--no-build-cache`: Clear the native cache before building. On iOS, this is the **derived data** directory. Cache clearing is useful for profiling your build times.
-   `--no-install`: Skip installing dependencies. On iOS, this will also skip running `npx pod-install` if the `dependencies` field in the project's `package.json` has changed.
-   `--no-bundler`: Skip starting the dev server. Enabled automatically if the dev server is already serving the app from a different process.
-   `-d, --device [device]`: Device name or ID to build the app on. You can pass `--device` without arguments to select a device from a list of available options. This supports connected devices as well as virtual devices.
-   `-p, --port <port>`: Port to start the development server. **Default: 8081**. This is only relevant for development builds. Production builds will [export](/more/expo-cli#exporting) the project and embed the files in the native binary before installing them on a device.
-   `--binary <path>`: File path to the binary to install on the device. When this is provided, the build process will be skipped and the binary will attempt to be installed directly. If the binary was not built for the correct device, for example, it is built for the simulator or installed on the device, then the command will fail.

#### Compiling Android

Android apps can have multiple different **variants** which are defined in the project's `build.gradle` file. Variants can be selected with the `--variant` flag:

##### `debug` variant

Use the `debug` variant for a debug build:

```sh
npx expo run:android --variant debug
```

##### `debugOptimized` variant

> `debugOptimized` is available in SDK 54 and later.

Use the `debugOptimized` variant for faster development with performance close to release builds while keeping the overall build in a debug-friendly mode:

```sh
npx expo run:android --variant debugOptimized
```

When using this variant, keep the following in mind:

-   Optimizes C++ libraries as in release builds, improving runtime performance
-   In EAS Build, use a matching Gradle command like [`:app:assembleDebugOptimized` in **eas.json**](/build-reference/apk#configuring-a-profile-to-build-apks)
-   **Limitation**: C++ debugging is disabled and C++ crashes may have less readable stack traces

##### `release` variant

You can compile the Android app for production by running:

```sh
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

This build is not automatically code-signed for submission to the Google Play Store. This command should be used to test bugs that may only show up in production builds. To generate a production build that is code signed for the Play Store, we recommend using [EAS Build](/build/introduction).

##### Debugging native Android project

You can debug the native Android project using native debugging tools by opening the **android** directory in Android Studio:

```sh
open -a /Applications/Android Studio.app android
```

If you have a customized Android project using different product flavors, you can configure both the flavor and application ID using the `--variant` and `--app-id` flags:

```sh
npx expo run:android --variant freeDebug --app-id dev.expo.myapp.free
```

For more information, see the [Local builds using Android product flavors](/guides/local-app-development#local-builds-using-android-product-flavors) guide.

#### Compiling iOS

An iOS app can have multiple **schemes** for representing different sub-apps like App Clips, watchOS apps, Safari Extensions, and so on. By default, `npx expo run:ios` will choose the scheme for your iOS app. You can pick a custom scheme with the `--scheme <my-scheme>` argument. If you pass in the `--scheme` argument alone, then Expo CLI will prompt you to choose a scheme from the list of available options in your Xcode project.

The scheme you select will filter out which `--device` options show up in the selection prompt, for example, selecting an Apple TV scheme will only show available Apple TV devices.

You can compile an iOS app for production by running:

```sh
npx expo run:ios --configuration Release
```

This build is not automatically code signed for submission to the Apple App Store. `npx expo run:ios` should mostly be used to test bugs that only show up in production builds. Native code signing requires several network requests and is prone to many different types of errors from the Apple servers. To generate a production build that is code signed for the App Store, we recommend using [EAS Build](/build/introduction).

When you compile your app onto a Simulator, the Simulator's native error logs will be piped to the Expo CLI process in the terminal. This is useful for quickly seeing bugs that may cause a fatal error. For example, missing permission messages. Error piping is not available for physical iOS devices.

You can debug using `lldb` and all of the native Apple debugging tools by opening the project in Xcode and rebuilding from Xcode:

```sh
xed ios
```

Building from Xcode is useful because you can set native breakpoints and profile any part of the application. Be sure to track changes in source control (git) in case you need to regenerate the native app with `npx expo prebuild -p ios --clean`.

**iOS development signing**

If you want to see how your app will run on your device, all you have to do is connect it, run `npx expo run:ios --device`, and select your connected device.

Expo CLI will automatically sign the device for development, install the app, and launch it.

If you don't have any developer profiles setup on your computer then you'll need to set them up manually outside of Expo CLI by following this guide: [Setup Xcode signing](https://expo.fyi/setup-xcode-signing).

### Exporting

You can export the JavaScript and assets for your app using Metro bundler by running:

```sh
npx expo export
```

This is done automatically when using `eas update` or when compiling the native runtime. The `export` command works similar to most web frameworks:

-   A bundler transpiles and bundles your application code for **production** environments, stripping all code guarded by the `__DEV__` boolean.
-   All static files are copied into a static **dist** directory which can be served from a static host.
-   Contents of the **public** directory are copied into the **dist** directory as-is.

The following options are provided:

-   `--platform <platform>`: Choose the platform to compile for: 'ios', 'android', 'all'. **Default: all**. 'web' is also available if configured in the app config. For more information, see [Customizing Metro](/guides/customizing-metro).
-   `--dev`: Bundle for **development** environments without minifying code or stripping the `__DEV__` boolean.
-   `--output-dir <dir>`: The directory to export the static files to. **Default: dist**
-   `--max-workers <number>`: Maximum number of tasks to allow the bundler to spawn. Setting this to `0` will run all transpilation on the same process, meaning you can easily debug Babel transpilation.
-   `-c, --clear`: Clear the bundler cache before exporting.
-   `--no-minify`: Skip minifying JavaScript and CSS assets.
-   `--no-bytecode`: Skip generating Hermes bytecode for native platforms. Only use this for analyzing bundle sizes and never ship UTF-8 bundles to native platforms as this will lead to drastically longer startup times.
-   `--no-ssg`: Skip exporting static HTML files for web routes. This option only generates server code inside the **dist** directory. Useful for [API routes](/router/web/api-routes).

#### Hosting with sub-paths

> Experimental functionality.

You can configure the prefix for static assets by setting the `experiments.baseUrl` field in your [app config](/workflow/configuration):

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "experiments": {
      "baseUrl": "/my-root"
    }
  }
}
```

This will export the website with all resources prefixed with `/my-root`. For example, an image at `assets/image.png` will be expected to be hosted at **/my-root/assets/image.png**. The actual file will be located in the same file system location as the entire directory is expected to be hosted at `/my-root` on the server.

Expo Router has built-in support for `baseUrl`. When using the `Link` and `router` APIs, the `baseUrl` will be automatically prepended to the URL.

```jsx
import { Link } from 'expo-router';

export default function Blog() {
  return <Link href="/blog/123">Go to blog post</Link>;
}
```

This will **export** to the following:

```html
<a href="/my-root/blog/123">Go to blog post</a>
```

If you use `<a>`, React Navigation, or the `Linking` API directly, you'll need to manually prepend the `baseUrl`.

The `baseUrl` functionality is production-only and must be set before exporting the website. If you change the value, you must re-export the website.

Images and other assets will work automatically if you `require` or `import` them. If you directly reference a resource URL then you will need to append the **baseUrl** manually.

```jsx
import { Image } from 'expo-image';

export default function Blog() {
  return <Image source={require('@/assets/image.png')} />;
}
```

This will **export** to the following:

```html
<img src="/my-root/assets/assets/image.png" />
```

Manually passing a URL will need to be manually prefixed:

```jsx
export default function Blog() {
  return <img src="/my-root/assets/image.png" />;
}
```

### Exporting with webpack

> **Deprecated**: In SDK 50 and later, Expo Webpack has been deprecated in favor of universal Metro (`npx expo export`). Learn more in [migrating from Webpack to Expo Router](/router/migrate/from-expo-webpack).

You can export the JavaScript and assets for your web app using webpack by running the following:

```sh
npx expo export:web
```

-   `--dev`: Bundle in 'development' mode without minifying code or stripping the `__DEV__` boolean.
-   `-c, --clear`: Clear the bundler cache before exporting.

This command will be disabled if your project is configured to use `metro` for bundling web projects in the `app.json` via the `expo.web.bundler: 'metro'` field.

## Prebuild

```sh
npx expo prebuild
```

Native source code must be generated before a native app can compile. Expo CLI provides a unique and powerful system called _prebuild_, that generates the native code for your project. To learn more, read the [Expo Prebuild docs](/workflow/prebuild).

## Lint

```sh
npx expo lint
```

Linting helps enforce best practices and ensure your code is consistent. The `npx expo lint` command will set up ESLint with Expo-specific settings and run the `npx eslint` command with options that are optimized for the Expo framework. By running `npx expo lint --fix`, linting issues can be fixed automatically.

Running `npx expo lint` targets all files in the **src**, **app**, and **components** directories by default. You can also pass custom files or directories to the lint command as arguments. For example:

```sh
npx expo lint ./utils constants.ts
```

All files matching `.js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx, .mjs, .cjs` extensions will be linted by default. You can customize the extensions by passing the `--ext` flag. For example, to lint only `.ts` and `.tsx` files, you can use the `--ext` option: `npx expo lint --ext .ts,.tsx` or `npx expo lint --ext .js --tsx .tsx`.

If you need additional customization, you can pass extra arguments using the `--` operator. For example, to pass the `--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern` flag to ESLint, you can run:

```sh
npx expo lint -- --no-error-on-unmatched-pattern
```

If you need more customization, you can use `npx eslint` directly.

[Using ESLint](/guides/using-eslint) — Learn more about ensuring best practices with ESLint in an Expo project.

## Config

Evaluate the app config (**app.json**, or **app.config.js**) by running:

```sh
npx expo config
```

-   `--full`: Include all project config data.
-   `--json`: Output in JSON format, useful for converting an **app.config.js** to an **app.config.json**.
-   `-t, --type`: [Type of config](/more/expo-cli#config-type) to show.

### Config type

There are three different config types that are generated from the app config:

-   `public`: The manifest file to use with OTA updates. Think of this like an `index.html` file's `<head />` element but for native apps.
-   `prebuild`: The config that is used for [Expo Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild) including async modifiers. This is the only time the config is not serializable.
-   `introspect`: A subset of the `prebuild` config that only shows in-memory modifications like `Info.plist` or **AndroidManifest.xml** changes. Learn more about [introspection](/config-plugins/development-and-debugging#introspection).

## Install

Unlike the web, React Native is not backwards compatible. This means that npm packages often need to be the exact right version for the currently installed copy of `react-native` in your project. Expo CLI provides a best-effort tool for doing this using a list of popular packages and the known working version combinations. Simply use the `install` command as a drop-in replacement for `npm install`:

```sh
npx expo install expo-camera
```

Running a single instance of this command, you can also install multiple packages:

```sh
npx expo install typescript expo-sms
```

You can directly pass arguments to the underlying package manager by using the `--` operator:

```sh
yarn expo install typescript -- -D
```

### Version validation

You can perform validation and correction with the `--check` and `--fix` flags:

-   `--check`: Check which installed packages need to be updated.
-   `--fix`: Automatically update any invalid package versions.

Example:

```sh
npx expo install --check
```

`npx expo install --check` prompts you about packages that are installed incorrectly. It also prompts about installing these packages to their compatible versions locally. It exits with non-zero in Continuous Integration (CI). This means you can use this to do continuous immutable validation. In contrast, `npx expo install --fix` will always fix packages if needed, regardless of the environment.

You can validate specific packages by passing them:

```sh
npx expo install react-native expo-sms --check
```

The command `npx expo install expo-camera` and `npx expo install expo-camera --fix` serve the same purpose, the `--fix` command is useful for upgrading all packages in your project like:

```sh
npx expo install --fix
```

### Configuring dependency validation

There may be circumstances where you want to use a version of a package that is different from the version recommended by `npx expo install`. In this case, you can exclude specific packages from version checking by using the [`expo.install.exclude`](/versions/latest/config/package-json#exclude) property in your project's **package.json**.

### Install package managers

`npx expo install` has support for `bun`, `npm`, `pnpm`, and `yarn`.

You can force the package manager using a named argument:

-   `--bun`: Use `bun` to install dependencies. Default when **bun.lockb** or **bun.lock** exists.
-   `--npm`: Use `npm` to install dependencies. Default when **package-lock.json** exists.
-   `--pnpm`: Use `pnpm` to install dependencies. Default when **pnpm-lock.yaml** exists.
-   `--yarn`: Use `yarn` to install dependencies. Default when **yarn.lock** exists.

## Authentication

Expo CLI provides authentication methods to use with the `npx expo start` command. Authentication is used to "code sign" manifests for secure OTA usage. Think of this like HTTPS on the web.

1.  Register an account with `npx expo register`.
2.  Login to your account with `npx expo login`.
3.  Check which account is currently authenticated with `npx expo whoami`.
4.  Logout with `npx expo logout`.

These credentials are shared across Expo CLI and EAS CLI.

## Customizing

Sometimes you may want to customize a project file that would otherwise be generated in memory by Expo CLI. When utilizing tools other than Expo CLI, you'll need to have the default config files present, otherwise your app may not work as expected. You can generate files by running:

```sh
npx expo customize
```

From here, you can choose to generate basic project files like:

-   **babel.config.js** -- The Babel configuration. This is required to be present if you plan to use tooling other than Expo CLI to bundle your project.
-   **webpack.config.js** -- The default webpack config for web development.
-   **metro.config.js** -- The default Metro config for universal development. This is required for usage with `npx react-native`.
-   **tsconfig.json** -- Create a TypeScript config file and install the required dependencies.

## Environment variables

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HTTP_PROXY` | **string** | HTTP/HTTPS proxy URL to connect for all network requests. Configures [Undici EnvHttpProxyAgent](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/blob/main/docs/docs/api/EnvHttpProxyAgent.md). |
| `EXPO_NO_WEB_SETUP` | **boolean** | Prevents the CLI from forcing web dependencies (`react-dom`, `react-native-web`, `@expo/webpack-config`) to be installed before using web functionality.This is useful for cases where you wish to perform non-standard web development. |
| `EXPO_OFFLINE` | **boolean** | Skip all network requests when applicable. This leads to faster development in areas with poor network connection. |
| `EXPO_NO_TYPESCRIPT_SETUP` | **boolean** | Prevents the CLI from forcing TypeScript to be configured on `npx expo start`.For more information, see [TypeScript guide](/guides/typescript). |
| `DEBUG=expo:*` | **string** | Enables debug logs for the CLI, you can configure this using the [`debug` convention](https://github.com/debug-js/debug#conventions). |

# Glossary of terms

List of non-obvious terms used within the documentation, related to Expo or cross-platform development in general.

### Android

The mobile operating system that is sponsored by Google for use with **Android** devices.

### App config

A file named **app.json**, **app.config.json**, **app.config.js**, or **app.config.ts** in the root project directory. For more information, see [app config configuration](/workflow/configuration).

This file is used for the following purposes:

-   To configure how [Expo CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-cli) works.
-   Generate a project's public [manifest](/more/glossary-of-terms#manifest) in EAS Update (think **index.html** but for native apps).
-   List Expo [config plugins](/more/glossary-of-terms#config-plugin) which influence how `npx expo prebuild` generates native code.

### app.json

An [app config](/more/glossary-of-terms#app-config) file.

### Apple capabilities

Cloud services that are provided by Apple. These services must be enabled for an application in the [Apple Developer Portal](/more/glossary-of-terms#apple-developer-portal).

### Apple Developer Portal

Apple's [official website](https://developer.apple.com/) for managing application code signing. EAS Credentials automate most of the common reasons a developer might visit this website when developing an app.

### Auto capability signing

A feature of EAS Build that automatically enables or disables [Apple capabilities](/more/glossary-of-terms#apple-capabilities) based on the project's entitlements file. [Learn more](/build-reference/ios-capabilities).

### Autolinking

A cross-platform tool for automatically linking native modules to native apps via native package managers.

-   On Android the tool is used in the **android/app/build.gradle** and invoked during the [Gradle](/more/glossary-of-terms#gradle) sync process.
-   On iOS the tool is used in [CocoaPods](/more/glossary-of-terms#cocoapods) **ios/Podfile** and invoked during `pod install`.

There are two versions of Autolinking: [Expo Autolinking](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-autolinking), and [Community Autolinking](/more/glossary-of-terms#community-autolinking).

The default [Prebuild template](/more/glossary-of-terms#prebuild-template) includes support for [Expo Autolinking](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-autolinking), and the [Community Autolinking](/more/glossary-of-terms#community-autolinking) fork.

### Babel

Transpiler used for removing language features that aren't available in the runtime's [JavaScript engine](/more/glossary-of-terms#javascript-engine). [Metro](/more/glossary-of-terms#metro-bundler) uses Babel internally.

Projects can configure how Babel is used by modifying the [**babel.config.js**](/versions/latest/config/babel) file in the project directory. This file is optional when using [Expo CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-cli). Expo projects should extend the default Babel preset [`babel-preset-expo`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/babel-preset-expo).

### Bare workflow

Describes the approach when the native projects (in the **android** and **ios** directories) are versioned in Git and maintained manually. It's typical for **existing "bare" React Native apps** where you manually make changes to the native projects. There is freedom to customize them but also high maintenance overhead.

This is in contrast to using [app config and prebuild](/workflow/prebuild), where the native projects are not versioned. Instead, they are generated on demand using the `npx expo prebuild`, which is the [recommended approach](/workflow/prebuild#pitch).

### Bun

A JavaScript runtime and a drop-in alternative for Node.js. Bun can also be used as a [package manager for JavaScript](/more/glossary-of-terms#package-manager). For more information about usage with Expo and EAS, see [using Bun](/guides/using-bun) guide.

### CocoaPods

The iOS package manager that is used to link native modules to the native iOS project. This package manager is configured using the **ios/Podfile** file and updated when a user runs `pod install` in the **ios** directory.

### Community Autolinking

This refers to the React Native community [fork](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/issues/248#issue-422591744) of the [Expo Autolinking](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-autolinking). The requirements for linking a module are different from [Expo Autolinking](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-autolinking), however, the implementation is the same.

### Config introspection

A process for evaluating the results of [`npx expo prebuild`](/more/glossary-of-terms#prebuild) in-memory without persisting any code changes. This is used in [Auto Capability Signing](/more/glossary-of-terms#auto-capability-signing) to determine what the entitlements file will look like without generating any native code. This process is also used in the [VS Code Expo](/more/glossary-of-terms#vs-code-expo) extension to debug [Config Mods](/more/glossary-of-terms#config-mods).

### Config Mods

Async functions that are appended to the [app config](/more/glossary-of-terms#app-config) for use in [Prebuild](/more/glossary-of-terms#prebuild). These functions are given a single native file to modify such as **AndroidManifest.xml** or **Info.plist**. Config mods are chained together and come from the package `@expo/config-plugins`. For more information, see [Config plugins](/config-plugins/introduction).

### Config Plugin

A JavaScript function that is used to append [config mods](/more/glossary-of-terms#config-mods) to the [app Config](/more/glossary-of-terms#app-config) for use in [Prebuild](/more/glossary-of-terms#prebuild). For more information, see [Config Plugins](/config-plugins/introduction).

### Continuous Native Generation (CNG)

An abstract concept that describes the process of generating native projects from a set of inputs. In the context of Expo, CNG is implemented via the [`prebuild`](/more/glossary-of-terms#prebuild) command. See [CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation) and [Expo Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild) for more information.

### create-expo-app

A standalone command line tool (CLI) for bootstrapping new React Native apps with the `expo` package installed. See [`create-expo-app` reference](/more/create-expo) for more information.

### create-react-native-app

A standalone command line tool (CLI) for bootstrapping new React Native apps with the `expo` package installed and the native code generated. This CLI also enables the use of bootstrapping from an example project in [expo/examples](https://github.com/expo/examples).

This package can be used by running any of the following commands:

-   `npx create-expo-app`
-   `yarn create expo-app`
-   `npm create expo-app`

### Dangerous mods

Config [modifiers](/more/glossary-of-terms#config-mods) that apply unstable changes to a native project during [prebuild](/more/glossary-of-terms#prebuild). Using these modifiers is unpredictable and prone to breaking changes between major version bumps in [Expo SDK](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-sdk). For more information, see [Using a dangerous mod](/config-plugins/dangerous-mods).

### Development build

A development build is a debug build of your app that contains the `expo-dev-client` package. It's like an evolution of [Expo Go](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-go) which doesn't have Expo Go's limitations and can be customized to your application's needs.

This is the recommended approach for building production-grade apps with Expo. For more information, see [Development builds](/get-started/set-up-your-environment?mode=development-build).

### Dev clients

`expo-dev-client` is a library that allows you to create a development build and includes useful development tools. You might also come across "custom dev client", a synonym for [Development builds](/more/glossary-of-terms#development-build).

### Development server

A development server (or dev server) is a server that is started locally, usually by running `npx expo start` from [Expo CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-cli).

The development server is typically hosted on `http://localhost:8081`. It hosts a [manifest](/more/glossary-of-terms#manifest) from `/` which the client uses to request the JavaScript bundle from the bundler.

### EAS

[Expo Application Services (EAS)](/eas) are deeply integrated cloud services for Expo and React Native apps, such as [EAS Build](/build/introduction), [EAS Submit](/submit/introduction) and [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction).

### EAS CLI

The command-line tool for working with EAS.

### EAS Config

The **eas.json** file used to configure [EAS CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#eas-cli). For more information, see [Configuring EAS Build with eas.json](/build/eas-json).

### EAS Metadata

A command-line tool for uploading and downloading Apple App Store metadata as JSON. This tool is available in the [EAS CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#eas-cli) package and should be used to improve the iOS submission process. For more information, see [EAS Metadata](/eas/metadata).

### EAS Update

1.  The cloud hosting service [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction) that is used for OTA Updates.
2.  The CLI command `eas update` from [EAS CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#eas-cli) used to publish static files to the cloud hosting service.

### Emulator

Emulator is used to describe software emulators of Android devices on your computers. Typically, iOS emulators are referred to as [Simulators](/more/glossary-of-terms#simulator).

### Entry point

The entry point usually refers to the initial JavaScript file used to load an application. In apps using [Expo CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-cli), the default entry point is **./node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js** which simply imports the **App.js** file from the root project directory and registers it as the initial component in the native app.

### Experience

A synonym for an app that usually implies something more single-use and smaller in scope, sometimes artistic and whimsical.

### Expo Autolinking

The original [Autolinking](/more/glossary-of-terms#autolinking) system is designed for projects using `expo-modules-core`. This system links modules based on the existence of an **expo-module.config.json** in the library's root directory.

### Expo CLI

The command-line tool for working with Expo. This term now refers to the [Local Expo CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#local-expo-cli), but historically referred to the [Global Expo CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#global-expo-cli). For more information, see [Expo CLI](/more/expo-cli).

### Expo client

The former name for the [Expo Go](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-go) app.

### Expo export

Refers to the command `npx expo export` from [Expo CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-cli). This command is used to bundle the app's JavaScript and assets, and then export them into a static directory that can be uploaded to a hosting service like [EAS Update](/more/glossary-of-terms#eas-update), and embedded in a [native runtime](/more/glossary-of-terms#native-runtime) for offline use.

### Expo Go

The Android and iOS app that serves as a sandbox for learning and experimenting with React Native.

Due to its limitations (such as the inability to include custom native code), it's not recommended for building and distributing production apps. Instead, use a [development build](/more/glossary-of-terms#development-build).

### Expo install

Refers to the command `npx expo install` from [Expo CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-cli). This command is used to install npm packages containing [native modules](/more/glossary-of-terms#native-module) that work with the currently installed version of `expo` in the project. Not all packages are supported. This command wraps the globally installed [package managers](/more/glossary-of-terms#package-manager).

### Expo Module Config

A file named **expo-module.config.json** that lives in the root directory of a [native module](/more/glossary-of-terms#native-module). For more information, see [Module Config](/modules/module-config).

### Expo SDK

A collection of [npm](/more/glossary-of-terms#npm) packages containing [native modules](/more/glossary-of-terms#native-module) that provides access to device/system functionality such as camera, push notification, contacts, file system, and more.

-   Each package supports Android, iOS, and web whenever possible.
-   The interface is completely written in [TypeScript](/more/glossary-of-terms#typescript).
-   All packages in the Expo SDK work with each other and can safely be compiled together.
-   Any package in the SDK can be used in any [React Native](/more/glossary-of-terms#react-native) app, with minimal, shared setup. [Learn more](/bare/installing-expo-modules).
-   All packages are [open source](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages) and can be freely customized.

### Expo start

Refers to the command `npx expo start` from [Expo CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-cli). This command is used to start a local [development server](/more/glossary-of-terms#development-server) that a [client](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-client) connects to interact with the [Metro bundler](/more/glossary-of-terms#metro-bundler).

### Fabric

The React Native rendering system which is used to create and manage native views. For more information, see [Fabric Renderer](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/fabric-renderer).

### Flipper

A mobile app debugger used internally at Meta. It was previously recommended for use with React Native, but the integration is now deprecated and no longer supported by the React Native team [(RFC-0641)](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/main/proposals/0641-decoupling-flipper-from-react-native-core.md).

### FYI

Sometimes referred to as **Expo FYI**, is a collection of tailored solutions to complex issues that live at [expo.fyi](https://expo.fyi/). FYI links are utilized throughout Expo's developer tooling to help provide a better developer experience to users.

### Global Expo CLI

The package `expo-cli` was installed globally on the user's machine and used across all projects. This CLI was introduced in SDK 30 (2018), and deprecated in favor of the [Local Expo CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#local-expo-cli) in SDK 46 (2022).

### Gradle

Gradle is a build automation tool for multi-language software development. It's used to build Android apps. It controls the development process in the tasks of compilation and packaging to testing, deployment, and publishing.

### Hermes engine

A [JavaScript engine](/more/glossary-of-terms#javascript-engine) developed by [Meta](/more/glossary-of-terms#meta) specifically for use with [React Native](/more/glossary-of-terms#react-native). Hermes features ahead-of-time static optimization and compact bytecode to improve performance with focus on mobile devices, and is the default JS engine.

### iOS

The operating system used on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. [Expo Go](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-go) currently runs on iOS for iPhone and iPad.

### JavaScript engine

A native package that can evaluate JavaScript on-device. In React Native, we predominantly use [Hermes](/more/glossary-of-terms#hermes-engine) by [Meta](/more/glossary-of-terms#meta). Other options include [JavaScriptCore](/more/glossary-of-terms#javascriptcore-engine) by Apple, and V8 by Google.

### JavaScriptCore engine

A [JavaScript engine](/more/glossary-of-terms#javascript-engine) developed by Apple and built-in to [iOS](/more/glossary-of-terms#ios). React Native for [Android](/more/glossary-of-terms#android) also can use a version of JavaScriptCore for parity. Debugging with JavaScriptCore is less sophisticated than V8 or [Hermes](/more/glossary-of-terms#hermes-engine) which implement the [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/).

### Linking

Linking can mean [deep linking into apps similar to how you link to websites on the web](/linking/overview) or [autolinking](/more/glossary-of-terms#autolinking).

### Local Expo CLI

The package `@expo/cli` is installed with the `expo` package. This is sometimes referred to as the "Versioned Expo CLI" because it is installed inside the user's project as opposed to the now deprecated `expo-cli` which was installed globally.

### Manifest

An Expo app manifest is similar to a [web app manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest). It provides information that Expo Go needs to know how to run the app and other relevant data.

### Meta

Formerly Facebook, Meta is the group that develops [React Native](/more/glossary-of-terms#react-native), [Metro Bundler](/more/glossary-of-terms#metro-bundler), [Hermes Engine](/more/glossary-of-terms#hermes-engine), [Yoga](/more/glossary-of-terms#yoga) and more. The Expo team collaborates with Meta to deliver the best possible developer experience.

### Metro bundler

The bundler used for converting JavaScript files and assets into a format that runs on a [native runtime](/more/glossary-of-terms#native-runtime). This bundler is maintained by [Meta](/more/glossary-of-terms#meta) and used for React Native (including web) apps. For more information, see [Metro documentation](https://metrobundler.dev/).

### Metro config

The **metro.config.js** file used to configure [Metro bundler](/more/glossary-of-terms#metro-bundler). This should extend the package `@expo/metro-config` when using [Expo CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-cli). For more information, see [Customizing Metro](/guides/customizing-metro).

### Monorepo

A project that has multiple sub-projects which are all linked together via the package manager. A monorepo is a great way to maintain codebase for a cross-platform app.

### Native directory

The React Native ecosystem has thousands of libraries. Without a purpose-built tool, it's hard to know what the libraries are, to search through them, to determine the quality, try them out, and filter out the libraries that won't work for your project (some don't work with Expo, some don't work with Android or iOS). [React Native Directory](https://reactnative.directory/) is a website that aims to solve this problem, we recommend you use it to find packages to use in your projects.

### Native module

A module written in native code that exposes native platform functionality to the JavaScript engine via the JS global. This functionality is usually accessed via `import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';`.

### Native runtime

A native application containing a [JavaScript engine](/more/glossary-of-terms#javascript-engine), and is capable of running a React application. This includes [Expo Go](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-go), [development build](/more/glossary-of-terms#development-build), [standalone apps](/more/glossary-of-terms#standalone-app), and even web browsers like Chrome.

### npm

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a [package manager for JavaScript](/more/glossary-of-terms#package-manager) and the registry where the packages are stored.

### Package manager

Automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing libraries, also known as dependencies, from your project. See [Bun](/more/glossary-of-terms#bun), [npm](/more/glossary-of-terms#npm), [pnpm](/more/glossary-of-terms#pnpm), and [Yarn](/more/glossary-of-terms#yarn).

### Package manager workspaces

The recommended [monorepo](/more/glossary-of-terms#monorepo) solution for Expo users. See [Working with Monorepos](/guides/monorepos) guide for more information on how to configure workspaces with supported package managers.

### Platform extensions

Platform extensions are a feature of the [Metro bundler](/more/glossary-of-terms#metro-bundler) which enables users to substitute files on a per-platform basis given a specific filename. For example, if a project has a **.index.js** file and a **.index.ios.js** file, then the **index.ios.js** will be used when bundling for iOS, and the **index.js** file will be used when bundling for all other platforms.

By default, platform extensions are resolved in `@expo/metro-config` using the following formula:

-   Android: **\*.android.js**, **\*.native.js**, **\*.js**
-   iOS: **\*.ios.js**, **\*.native.js**, **\*.js**
-   Web: **\*.web.js**, **\*.js**

### pnpm

[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is [package manager for JavaScript](/more/glossary-of-terms#package-manager), focused on disk space efficiency.

### Prebuild

The process of generating the temporary native **android** and **ios** directories for a React Native project based on the [app config](/more/glossary-of-terms#app-config). This process is performed by running the command `npx expo prebuild` from [Expo CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-cli) in a project directory.

See [Prebuild template](/more/glossary-of-terms#prebuild-template) and [Autolinking](/more/glossary-of-terms#autolinking) for further information.

### Prebuild template

The React Native project template is used as the first step of [Prebuilding](/more/glossary-of-terms#prebuild). This template is versioned with the [Expo SDK](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-sdk), and the template is chosen based on the installed version of `expo` in a project. After the template is cloned, `npx expo prebuild` evaluates the [app config](/more/glossary-of-terms#app-config) and runs the [Config mods](/more/glossary-of-terms#config-mods) which modify various files in the template.

Although the template can be changed by using the `npx expo prebuild --template /path/to/template` flag, the default prebuild template contains important initial defaults that the `npx expo prebuild` command makes assumptions about.

The default template currently lives at [`expo-template-bare-minimum`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/templates/expo-template-bare-minimum).

### Publish

We use the word "publish" as a synonym for "deploy". When you publish an app, it becomes available at a persistent URL from Expo Go, or in the case of [Standalone apps](/more/glossary-of-terms#standalone-app), it updates the app.

### React Native

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.

### React Native Web

A high-performing abstraction on top of `react-dom` that enables core primitives from [React Native](/more/glossary-of-terms#react-native) to run in the browser. React Native for web (RNW) was developed at X and is currently used for their [main website](https://x.com). [Expo SDK](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-sdk) and [Expo CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-cli) have first-class support for RNW.

### React Navigation

The preferred navigation library for React Native apps, developed and sponsored by the Expo team.

### Remote Debugging

Remote Debugging is a deprecated way of debugging React Native apps. A better alternative today is to use [Hermes](/more/glossary-of-terms#hermes-engine), as you can connect React Native DevTools to it.

Also known as Async Chrome Debugging, it was an experimental system for debugging React Native apps. The system works by executing the application JavaScript in a Chrome tab's web worker, then sending native commands over a websocket to the native device.

### Simulator

An emulator for iOS devices that you can run on macOS (or in [Snack](/more/glossary-of-terms#snack)) to work on your app without having to have a physical device handy.

### Slug

`slug` in the \[app config\]((#appjson) is a URL-friendly name for your project. It is unique across your Expo account.

### Snack

[Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/) is an in-browser development environment where you can build Expo [experiences](/more/glossary-of-terms#experience) without installing any tools on your phone or computer.

### Software Mansion

A development agency in Kraków, Poland. Maintainers of `react-native-gesture-handler`, `react-native-screens`, and `react-native-reanimated`. The platform team at Expo is composed of a number of contractors from Software Mansion. All of Software Mansion's core React Native libraries are supported in [Expo Go](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-go).

### Standalone app

Synonymous with "Production build". An application binary that can be submitted to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. For more information, see [Build your project for app stores](/deploy/build-project) or [Run builds locally or on your own infrastructure](/build-reference/local-builds).

### Store config

The **store.config.json** file used to configure [EAS Metadata](/more/glossary-of-terms#eas-metadata). This file can be generated from an existing App Store entry using `eas metadata:pull`.

### Sweet API

The Swift and Kotlin API for writing React Native modules. This API is provided by the library `expo-modules-core` which is shipped with the `expo` package. For more information, see [Module API](/modules/module-api).

### TypeScript

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. The Expo SDK is written in TypeScript, and we highly recommend using it. For more information, see our [TypeScript guide](/guides/typescript).

### Updates

Traditionally, apps for Android and iOS are updated by submitting an updated binary to the App and Play stores. Updates allow you to push an update to your app without the overhead of submitting a new release to the stores. For more information, see [Publishing](/eas-update/introduction) documentation.

### VS Code Expo Tools

The VS Code extension for improving the developer experience of working with app config files. This extension provides autocomplete and intellisense for the [app config](/more/glossary-of-terms#app-config), [Store Config](/more/glossary-of-terms#store-config), [Expo Module Config](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-module-config), and [EAS Config](/more/glossary-of-terms#eas-config). For more information, see the [VS Code Expo Tools extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=expo.vscode-expo-tools).

### Watchman

The file watcher used by [Metro](/more/glossary-of-terms#metro-bundler) to perform hot reloads during development. Watchman contains native code and may cause issues when installed globally. Watchman is maintained by [Meta](/more/glossary-of-terms#meta).

### webpack

The deprecated bundler used by [Expo CLI](/more/glossary-of-terms#expo-cli) for developing [`react-native-web`](/more/glossary-of-terms#react-native-web) apps.

### Yarn

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a [package manager for JavaScript](/more/glossary-of-terms#package-manager), created at Meta. It has two mainline versions [Yarn v1 (Classic)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) and [Yarn Berry](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry).

### Yoga

A native cross-platform library used by React Native internally to provide [CSS FlexBox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox) support to native views. React Native styles are passed to Yoga to lay out and style elements on the screen. For more information, see [Yoga](https://github.com/facebook/yoga) documentation.

# qr.expo.dev

Reference for the QR code generator at qr.expo.dev.

qr.expo.dev is a cloud function that generates Expo-branded QR codes. This function creates QR codes for [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction), which are used to preview updates in [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction) and Expo Go.

For example, if you and your team have a development build, and you'd like to load the latest update on a specific build's channel, you could go to the following endpoint to generate a QR code:

```text
https://qr.expo.dev/eas-update?projectId=your-project-id&runtimeVersion=your-runtime-version&channel=your-channel
```

Which would produce the following QR code SVG:

This QR code represents the following URL:

```text
exp+your-slug://expo-development-client/?url=https://u.expo.dev/your-project-id?runtime-version=your-runtime-version&channel-name=your-channel
```

This URL will deep link into a development build and instruct it to fetch the latest update on the specified channel.

> If sharing the URL is more convenient, you can request the URL directly by adding `format=url` to the query parameters.

## General

The following parameters apply to the `/eas-update` endpoint.

### Base query parameters

The following base query parameters can be included with any request to `/eas-update`.

| Param | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `slug` | No | exp | Use [`slug`](/versions/latest/config/app#slug) from [app config](/workflow/configuration) to target a development build. Otherwise use "exp" to target Expo Go. |
| `appScheme` (deprecated) | No | exp | Replaced by `slug`. Use `slug` instead. |
| `host` | No | u.expo.dev | The hostname of the server that handles update requests. |
| `format` | No | svg | Endpoints respond with SVGs by default. To receive a plain text URL, use `url`. |

### Update by device traits

Preview and production builds make requests to the EAS Update service with `runtimeVersion` and `channel` properties. You can emulate this behavior with the following query parameters:

| Param | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `projectId` | Yes | The ID of the project |
| `runtimeVersion` | Yes | The [runtime version](/eas-update/runtime-versions) of the build |
| `channel` | Yes | The channel name of the build |

#### Example

```text
https://qr.expo.dev/eas-update?projectId=your-project-id&runtimeVersion=your-runtime-version&channel=your-channel
```

### Update by ID

You can create a QR code for a specific update given its platform-specific ID.

| Param | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `updateId` | Yes | The ID of the update |

#### Example

```text
https://qr.expo.dev/eas-update?updateId=your-update-id
```

### Update by group ID

You can create a QR code for an update group given the update's group ID.

| Param | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `projectId` | Yes | The ID of the project |
| `groupId` | Yes | The ID of the update group |

#### Example

```text
https://qr.expo.dev/eas-update?projectId=your-project-id&groupId=your-update-id
```

### Update by branch ID

You can create a QR code with a branch's ID, which will return the latest update available on that branch.

| Param | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `projectId` | Yes | The ID of the project |
| `branchId` | Yes | The ID of the branch |

#### Example

```text
https://qr.expo.dev/eas-update?projectId=your-project-id&branchId=your-branch-id
```

### Update by channel ID

You can create a QR code with a channel's ID, which will return the latest update available on the branch or branches that are mapped to that channel.

| Param | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `projectId` | Yes | The ID of the project |
| `channelId` | Yes | The ID of the channel |

#### Example

```text
https://qr.expo.dev/eas-update?projectId=your-project-id&channelId=your-channel-id
```

# Release statuses

Learn about alpha, preview, beta, and stable release statuses and how they affect feature stability when using Expo SDK and Expo Application Services (EAS).

Expo uses different release statuses to indicate the stability and readiness of its tools and services. Understanding these statuses can help you make informed decisions about which features and versions to use in your projects.

## Alpha

Alpha features are available for early testing but may have significant limitations. These features are in the earliest stage of development and are shared with the community to gather feedback and shape their direction.

**What to expect:**

-   APIs are subject to breaking changes without major version bumps
-   Implementation may change substantially based on feedback
-   May have known bugs or performance issues
-   Not recommended for production apps

Alpha features are opportunities to influence the future of Expo. We encourage you to test these features in development environments and [provide feedback](https://expo.dev/contact) to help us refine them before they reach a wider audience.

## Preview

Preview features provide an early look at a slice of new functionality. Unlike alpha releases, preview features are designed with minimal overhead and limited scope, but they are not yet feature-complete.

**What to expect:**

-   A focused slice of functionality, not the full feature set
-   Designed with minimal overhead, but not yet fully validated for all production scenarios
-   APIs may evolve as the feature is built out further
-   Can be used in production with thorough testing, though functionality is limited

The purpose of a preview is to share new functionality early and gather feedback about a specific slice before building it out further. Your input directly helps shape the direction of the feature. [Share your feedback](https://expo.dev/contact) to help us prioritize what to build next.

## Beta

Beta features are feature-complete and undergoing final validation. These features have core functionality implemented and are being prepared for stable release.

**What to expect:**

-   Core functionality is complete and API shape is mostly settled
-   May have minor bugs or edge cases that are being addressed
-   Breaking changes are possible but unlikely unless critical issues are found
-   Can be used in production with thorough testing

Beta features are ready for real-world testing. While we don't expect major changes, we recommend testing thoroughly if you plan to use them in production. [Your feedback](https://expo.dev/contact) during this stage helps us catch any remaining issues before the stable release.

## Stable

Features without any status badge are considered stable and are fully released for production use. These features have been thoroughly tested and follow semantic versioning for any future changes.

**What to expect:**

-   Production-ready with full support
-   Breaking changes only occur in major version releases
-   Performance and stability have been validated
-   Documentation and examples available

Stable features are ready for use in any application. You can rely on them following semantic versioning principles, meaning breaking changes will only occur in major version updates.

## Deprecated

Deprecated features are those that are no longer recommended for use and will be removed in future releases. We provide deprecation warnings to give developers time to transition away from these features.

**What to expect:**

-   Warnings in documentation and code when using deprecated features
-   No new features or improvements will be made
-   Removal in future major releases

When you encounter a deprecated feature, we recommend planning to migrate to the suggested alternatives as soon as possible to ensure your projects remain up-to-date and maintainable.

# Expo Structured Field Values

Version 0

Structured Field Values for HTTP, [IETF RFC 8941](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8941), is a proposal to formalize header syntax and facilitate nested data.

Since it is still a work in progress, Expo maintains a custom version that only implements the following subset of the protocol defined in [IETF RFC 8941](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8941):

-   All key values
-   String, integer, and decimal items
-   Dictionaries

# Expo Updates v1

Version 1

## Introduction

This is the specification for Expo Updates, a protocol for delivering updates to Expo apps running on multiple platforms.

### Conformance

Conforming servers and client libraries must fulfill all normative requirements. Conformance requirements are described in this document by both descriptive assertions and key words with clearly defined meanings.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative portions of this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119). These key words may appear in lowercase and still retain their meaning unless explicitly declared as non-normative.

A conforming implementation of this protocol MAY provide additional functionality, but MUST NOT where explicitly disallowed or would otherwise result in non-conformance. Where relevant, unknown fields should be allowed and ignored by conforming clients.

### Overview

Conforming servers and client libraries MUST follow the HTTP spec as described in [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231) as well as the more precise guidance described in this spec.

-   An _update_ is defined as a [_manifest_](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#manifest-body) together with the assets referenced inside the manifest.
-   A [_directive_](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#directive-body) is defined as a message from the server that instructs clients to perform an action.

Expo Updates is a protocol for assembling and delivering updates and directives to clients.

The primary audiences of this spec are Expo Application Services and organizations that wish to manage their own update server to satisfy internal requirements.

## Client

> See the [reference client library](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-updates).

An app running a conformant Expo Updates client library MUST load the most recent _update_ saved in the client library's update database, possibly after filtering by the contents of the update's manifest [_metadata_](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#manifest-body).

The following describes how a conformant Expo Updates client library MUST retrieve a new update from a conformant server:

1.  The client library MUST make a [request](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#request) for the most recent update and directive, with constraints specified in the headers.
2.  If a [response](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#response) is received, the client library MUST process its contents:
    -   For a response containing an _update_, the client library SHALL proceed to make additional requests to download and store any new assets specified in the manifest. The manifest and assets together are considered a new _update_. The client library will edit its local state to reflect that a new update has been added to the local storage. It will also update the local state with the new `expo-manifest-filters` and `expo-server-defined-headers` found in the response [headers](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#manifest-response-headers).
    -   For a response containing a _directive_, the client library will consume the directive depending on the directive type and edit its local state accordingly.

## Request

A conformant client library MUST make a GET request with the headers:

1.  `expo-protocol-version: 1`, to specify version 1 of this Expo Updates specification.
2.  `expo-platform`, to specify the platform type the client is running on.
    -   iOS MUST be `expo-platform: ios`.
    -   Android MUST be `expo-platform: android`.
    -   If it is not one of these platforms, the server SHOULD return a 400 or a 404
3.  `expo-runtime-version` MUST be a runtime version compatible with the client. A runtime version stipulates the native code setup a client is running. It should be set when the client is built. For example, in an iOS client, the value may be set in a plist file.
4.  Any headers stipulated by a previous responses' [server defined headers](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#response).

A conformant client library MAY send one of `accept: application/expo+json`, `accept: application/json`, or `accept: multipart/mixed` based on the [supported response structures](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#response), though it SHOULD send `accept: application/expo+json, application/json, multipart/mixed`. A conformant client library MAY express preference using "q" parameters as specified in [RFC 7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.1), which default to `1`.

A conformant client library configured to perform [code signing](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#code-signing) verification MUST send a `expo-expect-signature` header to indicate that it expects the conformant server to include the `expo-signature` header in the manifest response. `expo-expect-signature` is an [Expo SFV](/technical-specs/expo-sfv-0) dictionary which MAY contain any of the following key value pairs:

-   `sig` SHOULD contain the boolean `true` to indicate that it requires a conformant server to respond with the signature in the `sig` key.
-   `keyid` SHOULD contain the keyId of the public key the client will use to verify the signature
-   `alg` SHOULD contain the algorithm the client will use to verify the signature

Example:

```text
expo-protocol-version: 1
accept: application/expo+json;q=0.9, application/json;q=0.8, multipart/mixed
expo-platform: *
expo-runtime-version: *
expo-expect-signature: sig, keyid="root", alg="rsa-v1_5-sha256"
```

## Response

A conformant server MUST return a response structured in at least one of the two following response structures, MAY support either or both response structures, and when an unsupported response structure is requested the server SHOULD respond with an HTTP `406` error status. A server that wishes to respond with an incompatible response for the requested protocol version SHOULD also respond with an HTTP `406` error status instead.

-   For a response with `content-type: application/json` or `content-type: application/expo+json`, the [common response headers](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#common-response-headers) and [other response headers](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#other-response-headers) MUST be sent in the response headers and the [manifest body](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#manifest-body) MUST be sent in the response body. This format of response does not support multiple response parts and therefore does not support _directives_, and SHOULD respond with an HTTP `406` error status when the most recent response to be served is not an _update_.
-   For a response with `content-type: multipart/mixed`, the response MUST be structured as specified in the [multipart response](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#multipart-response) section.
-   A [multipart response](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#multipart-response) with no parts MAY respond with an HTTP `204` status and no content, and thus no `content-type` response header.

The choice of update and headers are dependent on the values of the request headers. A conformant server MUST respond with the most recent update, ordered by creation time, satisfying all parameters and constraints imposed by the [request headers](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#request). The server MAY use any properties of the request like its headers and source IP address to choose among several updates that all satisfy the request's constraints.

### Common response headers

```text
expo-protocol-version: 1
expo-sfv-version: 0
expo-manifest-filters: <expo-sfv>
expo-server-defined-headers: <expo-sfv>
cache-control: *
content-type: *
```

-   `expo-protocol-version` describes the version of the protocol defined in this spec and MUST be `1`.
-   `expo-sfv-version` MUST be `0`.
-   `expo-manifest-filters` is an [Expo SFV](/technical-specs/expo-sfv-0) dictionary. It is used to filter updates stored by the client library by the `metadata` attribute found in the [manifest](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#manifest-body). If a field is mentioned in the filter, the corresponding field in the metadata must either be missing or equal for the update to be included. The client library MUST store the manifest filters until it is overwritten by a newer response.
-   `expo-server-defined-headers` is an [Expo SFV](/technical-specs/expo-sfv-0) dictionary. It defines headers that a client library MUST store until overwritten by a newer dictionary, and they MUST be included in every subsequent [update request](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#request).
-   `cache-control` MUST be set to an appropriately short period of time. A value of `cache-control: private, max-age=0` is recommended to ensure the newest manifest is returned. Setting longer cache ages could result in stale updates.
-   `content-type` MUST be determined by _proactive negotiation_ as defined in [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.4.1). Since the client library is [required](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#request) to send an `accept` header with each manifest request, this will always be either `application/expo+json`, `application/json`; otherwise the request would return a `406` error.

### Other response headers

```text
expo-signature: *
```

-   `expo-signature` SHOULD contain the signature of the manifest to be used during the validation step of [code signing](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#code-signing) if the request for the manifest contained the `expo-expect-signature` header. This is an [Expo SFV](/technical-specs/expo-sfv-0) dictionary which MAY contain any of the following key value pairs:
    -   `sig` MUST contain the signature of the manifest. The name of this field matches that of `expo-expect-signature`.
    -   `keyid` MAY contain the keyId of the key the server used to sign the response. The client SHOULD use the certificate that matches this `keyid` to verify the signature.
    -   `alg` MAY contain the algorithm the server used to sign the response. The client SHOULD use this field only if it matches the algorithm defined for the certificate matching `keyid`.

### Multipart response

An update response of this format is defined by the `multipart/mixed` MIME type as defined by [RFC 2046](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046#section-5.1).

Headers for this response format are the [common response headers](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#common-response-headers), with the following exceptions:

-   `content-type` SHOULD have a `multipart/mixed` value as defined by [RFC 2046](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046#section-5.1)

Part order is not strict. A multipart response with no parts (zero-length body) should be considered a no-op (no updates or directives available), though headers for the response SHOULD be sent nevertheless and processed by the client.

Each part is defined as follows:

1.  OPTIONAL `"manifest"` part:
    -   MUST have part header `content-disposition: form-data; name="manifest"`. The first parameter (`form-data`) does not need to be `form-data`, but the `name` parameter must have `manifest` as a value.
    -   MUST have part header `content-type: application/json` or `application/expo+json`.
    -   SHOULD have part header `expo-signature` as defined in [other response headers](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#other-response-headers) if code signing is being used.
    -   The [manifest body](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#manifest-body) MUST be sent in the part body.
2.  OPTIONAL `"extensions"` part:
    -   MUST have part header `content-disposition: form-data; name="extensions"`. The first parameter (`form-data`) does not need to be `form-data`, but the `name` parameter must have `extensions` as a value.
    -   MUST have part header `content-type: application/json`.
    -   The [extensions-body](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#extensions-body) MUST be sent in the part body.
3.  OPTIONAL `"directive"` part:
    -   MUST have part header `content-disposition: form-data; name="directive"`. The first parameter (`form-data`) does not need to be `form-data`, but the `name` parameter must have `directive` as a value.
    -   MUST have part header `content-type: application/json` or `application/expo+json`.
    -   SHOULD have part header `expo-signature` as defined in [other response headers](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#other-response-headers) if code signing is being used.
    -   The [directive body](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#directive-body) MUST be sent in the part body.

### Manifest body

Defined as JSON conforming to both the following `Manifest` definition expressed in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and the detailed descriptions for each field:

```ts
type Manifest = {
  id: string;
  createdAt: string;
  runtimeVersion: string;
  launchAsset: Asset;
  assets: Asset[];
  metadata: { [key: string]: string };
  extra: { [key: string]: any };
};

type Asset = {
  hash?: string;
  key: string;
  contentType: string;
  fileExtension?: string;
  url: string;
};
```

-   `id`: The ID MUST uniquely specify the manifest and MUST be a UUID.
    
-   `createdAt`: The date and time at which the update was created is essential as the client library selects the most recent update (subject to any constraints supplied by the `expo-manifest-filters` header). The datetime should be formatted according to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).
    
-   `runtimeVersion`: Can be any string defined by the developer. It stipulates what native code setup is required to run the associated update.
    
-   `launchAsset`: A special asset that is the entry point of the application code. The `fileExtension` field will be ignored for this asset and SHOULD be omitted.
    
-   `assets`: An array of assets used by the update bundle, such as JavaScript, pictures, and fonts. All assets (including the `launchAsset`) should be downloaded to disk before executing the update, and a mapping of asset `key`s to locations on disk should be provided to application code.
    
-   Properties of each asset object:
    
    -   `hash`: Base64URL-encoded SHA-256 hash of the file to guarantee integrity. Base64URL encoding is defined by [IETF RFC 4648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-5).
    -   `key`: Key used to reference this asset from the update's application code. This key, for example, may be generated by a separate build step that processes the application code, such as a bundler.
    -   `contentType`: The MIME type of the file as defined by [RFC 2045](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045). For example, `application/javascript`, `image/jpeg`.
    -   `fileExtension`: The suggested extension to use when a file is saved on a client. Some platforms, such as iOS, require certain file types to be saved with an extension. The extension MUST be prefixed with a `.`. For example, **.jpeg**. In some cases, such as the launchAsset, this field will be ignored in favor of a locally determined extension. If the field is omitted and there is no locally stipulated extension, the asset will be saved without an extension. For example, `./filename` with no `.` at the end. A conforming client SHOULD prefix a file extension with a `.` if a file extension is not empty and missing the `.` prefix.
    -   `url`: Location at which the file may be fetched.
-   `metadata`: The metadata associated with an update. It is a string-valued dictionary. The server MAY send back anything it wishes to be used for filtering the updates. The metadata MUST pass the filter defined in the accompanying `expo-manifest-filters` header.
    
-   `extra`: For storage of optional "extra" information such as third-party configuration. For example, if the update is hosted on Expo Application Services (EAS), the EAS project ID may be included:
    
    ```json
    "extra": {
      "eas": {
        "projectId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
      }
    }
    ```
    

### Extensions body

Defined as JSON conforming to both the following `Extensions` definition expressed in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and the detailed descriptions for each field:

```ts
type Extensions = {
  assetRequestHeaders: ExpoAssetHeaderDictionary;
  ...
}

type ExpoAssetHeaderDictionary = {
  [assetKey: string]: {
    [headerName: string]: string,
  };
}
```

-   `assetRequestHeaders`: MAY contain a dictionary of header (key, value) pairs to include with asset requests. Key and value MUST both be strings.

### Directive body

Defined as JSON conforming to both the following `Directive` definition expressed in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and the detailed descriptions for each field:

```ts
type Directive = {
  type: string;
  parameters?: { [key: string]: any };
  extra?: { [key: string]: any };
};
```

-   `type`: The type of directive.
-   `parameters`: MAY contain any extra information specific to the `type`.
-   `extra`: For storage of optional "extra" information such as third-party information. For example, if the update is hosted on Expo Application Services (EAS), the EAS project ID may be included.

A conformant client library and server MAY specify and implement directive types specific to the needs of the application. For example, Expo Application Services makes use of one type thus far, `rollBackToEmbedded`, which directs the expo-updates library to use the update embedded in the host application instead of any other downloaded updates.

## Asset request

A conformant client library MUST make a GET request to the asset URLs specified by the manifest. The client library SHOULD include a header accepting the asset's content type as specified in the manifest. Additionally, the client library SHOULD specify the compression encoding the client library is capable of handling.

Example headers:

```text
accept: image/jpeg, */*
accept-encoding: br, gzip
```

A conformant client library MUST also include any header (key, value) pairs included in [`assetRequestHeaders`](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1#manifest-extensions) for this asset key.

## Asset response

An asset located at a particular URL MUST NOT be changed or removed since client libraries may fetch assets for any update at any time. A conformant client MUST verify that the base64url-encoded SHA-256 hash of the asset matches the `hash` field for the asset from the manifest.

### Asset response headers

The asset MUST be encoded using a compression format that the client supports according to the request's `accept-encoding` header. The server MAY serve uncompressed assets. The response MUST include a `content-type` header with the MIME type of the asset. For example:

```text
content-encoding: br
content-type: application/javascript
```

An asset is RECOMMENDED to be served with a `cache-control` header set to a long duration as an asset located at a given URL must not change. For example:

```text
cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```

### Compression

Assets SHOULD be capable of being served with [Gzip](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/) and [Brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli) compression.

## Code signing

Expo Updates supports code signing the manifest and directive bodies. Code signing the manifest also transitively signs the assets since their hashes are present in the manifest and verified by a conformant client. A conformant client MAY request the manifest or directive be signed using a private key, and then MUST verify the signature of the manifest or directive using the corresponding code signing certificate before it is used or any corresponding manifest assets are downloaded. The client MUST verify that the signing certificate is either a self-signed, trusted root certificate or is in a certificate chain signed by a trusted root certificate. In either case, the root certificate MUST be embedded in the application or device's operating system.

### `backgroundColor`

Type: `string`

The background color for your app, behind any of your React views. This is also known as the root view background color. Requires `expo-system-ui` be installed in your project to work on iOS.

6 character long hex color string, for example, `'#000000'`. Default is white: `'#ffffff'`

### `primaryColor`

Type: `string`

On Android, this will determine the color of your app in the multitasker. Currently this is not used on iOS, but it may be used for other purposes in the future.

6 character long hex color string, for example, `'#000000'`

### `icon`

Type: `string`

Local path or remote URL to an image to use for your app's icon. We recommend that you use a 1024x1024 png file. This icon will appear on the home screen and within the Expo Go app.

Existing React Native app?

To change your app's icon, edit or replace the files in `ios/<PROJECT-NAME>/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` (we recommend using Xcode), and `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-<RESOLUTION>`. Be sure to follow the guidelines for each platform ([iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/app-icon/), [Android 7.1 and below](https://material.io/design/iconography/#icon-treatments), and [Android 8+](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_adaptive)) and to provide your new icon in each existing size.

### `androidStatusBar`

Type: `object`

Configuration for the status bar on Android. For more details navigate to [Configuring StatusBar](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/configuring-statusbar/).

#### `barStyle`

Type: `enum` • Path: `androidStatusBar.barStyle`

Configures the status bar icons to have a light or dark color. Valid values: `light-content`, `dark-content`. Defaults to `dark-content`

#### `backgroundColor`

Type: `string` • Path: `androidStatusBar.backgroundColor`

Specifies the background color of the status bar. Defaults to `#00000000` (transparent) for `dark-content` bar style and `#00000088` (semi-transparent black) for `light-content` bar style

6 character long hex color string `'#RRGGBB'`, for example, `'#000000'` for black. Or 8 character long hex color string `'#RRGGBBAA'`, for example, `'#00000088'` for semi-transparent black.

Instructs the system whether the status bar should be visible or not. Defaults to `false`

#### `translucent`

Type: `boolean` • Path: `androidStatusBar.translucent`

When false, the system status bar pushes the content of your app down (similar to `position: relative`). When true, the status bar floats above the content in your app (similar to `position: absolute`). Defaults to `true` to match the iOS status bar behavior (which can only float above content). Explicitly setting this property to `true` will add `android:windowTranslucentStatus` to `styles.xml` and may cause unexpected keyboard behavior on Android when using the `softwareKeyboardLayoutMode` set to `resize`. In this case you will have to use `KeyboardAvoidingView` to manage the keyboard layout.

### `androidNavigationBar`

`leanback` results in the navigation bar being hidden until the first touch gesture is registered.

`immersive` results in the navigation bar being hidden until the user swipes up from the edge where the navigation bar is hidden.

`sticky-immersive` is identical to `'immersive'` except that the navigation bar will be semi-transparent and will be hidden again after a short period of time.

#### `barStyle`

Type: `enum` • Path: `androidNavigationBar.barStyle`

Configure the navigation bar icons to have a light or dark color. Supported on Android Oreo and newer. Valid values: `'light-content'`, `'dark-content'`

# babel.config.js

A reference for Babel configuration file.

Babel is used as the JavaScript compiler to transform modern JavaScript (ES6+) into a version compatible with the JavaScript engine on mobile devices.

Each new Expo project created using `npx create-expo-app` configures Babel automatically and uses [`babel-preset-expo`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/babel-preset-expo) as the default preset. There is no need to create a **babel.config.js** file unless you need to customize the Babel configuration.

## Create babel.config.js

If your project requires a custom Babel configuration, you need to create the **babel.config.js** file in your project by following the steps below:

1.  Navigate to the root of your project and run the following command inside a terminal. This will generate a **babel.config.js** file in the root of your project.

```sh
npx expo customize babel.config.js
```

2.  The **babel.config.js** file contains the following default configuration:

```js
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
  };
};
```

3.  If you make a change to the **babel.config.js** file, you need to restart the Metro bundler to apply the changes and use `--clear` option from Expo CLI to clear the Metro bundler cache:

```sh
npx expo start --clear
```

## babel-preset-expo

[`babel-preset-expo`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/babel-preset-expo) is the default preset used in Expo projects. It extends the default React Native preset (`@react-native/babel-preset`) and adds support for decorators, tree-shaking web libraries, and loading font icons.

# metro.config.js

A reference of available configurations in Metro.

See more information about **metro.config.js** in the [customizing Metro guide](/guides/customizing-metro).

## Environment variables

Expo CLI can load environment variables from **.env** files. Learn more about how to use environment variables in Expo CLI in the [environment variables guide](/guides/environment-variables).

EAS CLI uses a different mechanism for environment variables, except when it invokes Expo CLI for compiling and bundling. Learn more about [environment variables in EAS](/build-reference/variables).

If you are migrating an older project, then you should ignore local env files by adding the following to your **.gitignore**:

```sh
# local env files
.env*.local
```

### Disabling dotenv files

Dotenv file loading can be fully disabled in Expo CLI by enabling the `EXPO_NO_DOTENV` environment variable, before invoking any Expo CLI command.

```sh
npx cross-env EXPO_NO_DOTENV=1 expo start
EXPO_NO_DOTENV=1 npx expo start
```

### Disabling `EXPO_PUBLIC_`-prefixed client environment variables

Environment variables prefixed with `EXPO_PUBLIC_` will be exposed to the app at build-time. For example, `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_KEY` will be available as `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_KEY`.

Client environment variable inlining can be disabled with the environment variable `EXPO_NO_CLIENT_ENV_VARS=1`, this must be defined before any bundling is performed.

```sh
npx cross-env EXPO_NO_CLIENT_ENV_VARS=1 expo start
EXPO_NO_CLIENT_ENV_VARS=1 npx expo start
```

## CSS

> CSS support is under development and currently only works on web.

Expo supports CSS in your project. You can import CSS files from any component. CSS Modules are also supported.

CSS support is enabled by default. You can disable the feature by setting `isCSSEnabled` in the Metro config.

```js
/** @type {import('expo/metro-config').MetroConfig} */
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname, {
  // Disable CSS support.
  isCSSEnabled: false,
});
```

### Global CSS

> Global styles are web-only, usage will cause your application to diverge visually on native.

You can import a CSS file from any component. The CSS will be applied to the entire page.

Here, we'll define a global style for the class name `.container`:

```css
.container {
  background-color: red;
}
```

We can then use the class name in our component by importing the stylesheet and using `.container`:

```jsx
import './styles.css';
import { View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Use `className` to assign the style with React DOM components. */}
      <div className="container">Hello World</div>

      {/* Use `style` with the following syntax to append class names in React Native for web. */}
      <View
        style={{
          $$css: true,
          _: 'container',
        }}>
        Hello World
      </View>
    </>
  );
}
```

You can also import stylesheets that are vendored in libraries, just like you would any node module:

```js
// Applies the styles app-wide.
import 'emoji-mart/css/emoji-mart.css';
```

-   On native, all global stylesheets are automatically ignored.
-   Hot reloading is supported for global stylesheets, simply save the file and the changes will be applied.

### CSS Modules

> CSS Modules for native are under development and currently only work on web.

CSS Modules are a way to scope CSS to a specific component. This is useful for avoiding naming collisions and for ensuring that styles are only applied to the intended component.

In Expo, CSS Modules are defined by creating a file with the `.module.css` extension. The file can be imported from any component. The exported value is an object with the class names as keys and the web-only scoped names as the values. The import `unstable_styles` can be used to access `react-native-web`-safe styles.

CSS Modules support platform extensions to allow you to define different styles for different platforms. For example, you can define a `module.ios.css` and `module.android.css` file to define styles for Android and iOS respectively. You'll need to import without the extension, for example:

Flipping the extension, for example, `App.ios.module.css` will not work and result in a universal module named `App.ios.module`.

> You cannot pass styles to the `className` prop of a React Native or React Native for web component. Instead, you must use the `style` prop.

```jsx
import styles, { unstable_styles } from './App.module.css';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <Text
        style={{
          // This is how react-native-web class names are applied
          $$css: true,
          _: styles.text,
        }}>
        Hello World
      </Text>
      <Text style={unstable_styles.text}>Hello World</Text>
      {/* Web-only usage: */}
      <p className={styles.text}>Hello World</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
.text {
  color: red;
}
```

-   On web, all CSS values are available. CSS is not processed or auto-prefixed like it is with the React Native Web `StyleSheet` API. You can use `postcss.config.js` to autoprefix your CSS.
-   CSS Modules use [lightningcss](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/lightningcss) under the hood, check [the issues](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/lightningcss/issues) for unsupported features.

### PostCSS

[PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) can be customized by adding a `postcss.config.json` file to the root of your project. This file should export a function that returns a PostCSS configuration object. For example:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "tailwindcss": {}
  }
}
```

Both `postcss.config.json` and `postcss.config.js` are supported, but `postcss.config.json` enables better caching.

Expo CLI automatically handles CSS vendor prefixes with built-in support for [browserslist](https://browsersl.ist/). Avoid adding `autoprefixer` as this duplicates the functionality and slows down bundling.

#### Resetting cache after updates

Changing the Post CSS or `browserslist` config will require you to clear the Metro cache:

```sh
npx expo start --clear
npx expo export --clear
```

### browserslist

Expo has automatic [browserslist](https://browsersl.ist/) support via the Rust-based CSS parser. You can customize the CSS vendor prefixes and browser support by adding a **browserslist** field to your **package.json** file. For example:

```json
{
  "browserslist": [">0.2%", "not dead", "not op_mini all"]
}
```

### SASS

Expo Metro has _partial_ support for SCSS/SASS.

To setup, install the `sass` package in your project:

```sh
yarn add -D sass
```

Then, ensure [CSS is setup](/versions/latest/config/metro#css) in the **metro.config.js** file.

-   When `sass` is installed, then modules without extensions will be resolved in the following order: `scss`, `sass`, `css`.
-   Only use the intended syntax with `sass` files.
-   Importing other files from inside a scss/sass file is not currently supported.

### Tailwind

> Standard Tailwind CSS supports only web platform. For universal support, use a library such as [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/), which allows creating styled React Native components with Tailwind CSS.

[Tailwind CSS](/guides/tailwind) — Learn how to configure and use Tailwind CSS in your Expo project.

## Extending the Babel transformer

Expo's Metro config uses a custom `transformer.babelTransformerPath` value to ensure `expo-babel-preset` is always used and web/Node.js environments are supported.

If you want to extend the Babel transformer, import the upstream transformer from `@expo/metro-config/babel-transformer` instead of `metro-react-native-babel-transformer`. For example:

```js
const upstreamTransformer = require('@expo/metro-config/babel-transformer');

module.exports.transform = async ({ src, filename, options }) => {
  // Do something custom for SVG files...
  if (filename.endsWith('.svg')) {
    src = '...';
  }
  // Pass the source through the upstream Expo transformer.
  return upstreamTransformer.transform({ src, filename, options });
};
```

## Custom resolving

Expo CLI extends the default Metro resolver to add features like Web, Server, and tsconfig aliases support. You can similarly customize the default resolution behavior of Metro by chaining the `config.resolver.resolveRequest` function.

```tsx
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

/** @type {import('expo/metro-config').MetroConfig} */
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

config.resolver.resolveRequest = (context, moduleName, platform) => {
  if (moduleName.startsWith('my-custom-resolver:')) {
    // Logic to resolve the module name to a file path...
    // NOTE: Throw an error if there is no resolution.
    return {
      filePath: 'path/to/file',
      type: 'sourceFile',
    };
  }

  // Ensure you call the default resolver.
  return context.resolveRequest(context, moduleName, platform);
};

module.exports = config;
```

Unlike traditional bundlers, Metro shared the same resolver function across all platforms. As a result, you can mutate the resolution settings dynamically on each request with the `context` object.

### Mocking modules

If you want a module to be empty for a given platform, you can return a `type: 'empty'` object from the resolver. The following example will cause `lodash` to be empty on web:

```ts
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

/** @type {import('expo/metro-config').MetroConfig} */
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

config.resolver.resolveRequest = (context, moduleName, platform) => {
  if (platform === 'web' && moduleName === 'lodash') {
    return {
      type: 'empty',
    };
  }

  // Ensure you call the default resolver.
  return context.resolveRequest(context, moduleName, platform);
};

module.exports = config;
```

This technique is equivalent to using empty externals in Webpack or Vite, but with the added benefit of being able to target specific platforms.

### Virtual modules

Metro doesn't support virtual modules at the moment. One technique you can use to obtain similar behavior is to create a module in the `node_modules/.cache/...` directory and redirect the resolution to that file.

The following example will create a module at `node_modules/.cache/virtual/virtual-module.js` and redirect the resolution of `virtual:my-module` to that file:

```ts
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

/** @type {import('expo/metro-config').MetroConfig} */
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

const virtualPath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/.cache/virtual/virtual-module.js');

// Create the virtual module in a generated directory...
fs.mkdirSync(path.dirname(virtualPath), { recursive: true });
fs.writeFileSync(virtualPath, 'export default "Hello World";');

config.resolver.resolveRequest = (context, moduleName, platform) => {
  if (moduleName === 'virtual:my-module') {
    return {
      filePath: virtualPath,
      type: 'sourceFile',
    };
  }

  // Ensure you call the default resolver.
  return context.resolveRequest(context, moduleName, platform);
};

module.exports = config;
```

This can be used to emulate `externals` with custom imports. For example, if you want to redirect `require('expo')` to something custom like `SystemJS.require('expo')`, you can create a virtual module that exports `SystemJS.require('expo')` and redirect the resolution of `expo` to that file.

## Custom transforming

> Transformations are heavily cached in Metro. If you update something, use the `--clear` flag to see updates. For example, `npx expo start --clear`.

Metro doesn't have a very expressive plugin system for transforming files, instead opt to use the [**babel.config.js**](/versions/latest/config/babel) and caller object to customize the transformation.

```js
module.exports = function (api) {
  // Get the platform that Expo CLI is transforming for.
  const platform = api.caller(caller => (caller ? caller.platform : 'ios'));

  // Detect if the bundling operation is for Hermes engine or not, e.g. `'hermes'` | `undefined`.
  const engine = api.caller(caller => (caller ? caller.engine : null));

  // Is bundling for a server environment, e.g. API Routes.
  const isServer = api.caller(caller => (caller ? caller.isServer : false));

  // Is bundling for development or production.
  const isDev = api.caller(caller =>
    caller
      ? caller.isDev
      : process.env.BABEL_ENV === 'development' || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
  );

  // Ensure the config is not cached otherwise the platform will not be updated.
  api.cache(false);
  // You can alternatively provide a more robust CONFIG cache invalidation:
  // api.cache.invalidate(() => platform);

  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: [
      // Add a plugin based on the platform...
      platform === 'web' && 'my-plugin',

      // Ensure you filter out falsy values.
    ].filter(Boolean),
  };
};
```

If the caller doesn't have `engine`, `platform`, `bundler`, and so on, then ensure you are using `@expo/metro-config/babel-transformer` for the transformer. If you're using a custom transformer then it may need to extend the Expo transformer.

Always try to implement custom logic in the resolver if possible, caching is much simpler and easier to reason about. For example, if you need to remap an import, it's simpler and faster to resolve to a static file with the resolver than to parse all possible import methods and remap them with the transformer.

Always use `babel-preset-expo` as the default Babel preset, this ensures the transformation is always compatible with Expo runtimes. `babel-preset-expo` uses all of the caller inputs internally to optimize for a given platform, engine, and environment.

## Node.js built-ins

When bundling for a server environment, Expo's Metro config automatically supports externalizing Node.js built-in modules (`fs`, `path`, `node:crypto`, and more) based on the current Node.js version. If the CLI is bundling for a browser environment, then built-ins will first check if the module is installed locally, then fallback on an empty shim. For example, if you install `path` for use in the browser, this can be used, otherwise, the module will automatically be skipped.

## Environment settings

> These environment variables will not be defined in test environments.

Expo's Metro config injects build settings that can be used in the client bundle via environment variables. All variables will be inlined and cannot be used dynamically. For example, `process.env["EXPO_BASE_URL"]` won't work.

-   `process.env.EXPO_BASE_URL` exposes the base URL defined in `experiments.baseUrl`. This is used in Expo Router to respect the production base URL for deployment.

## Bundle splitting

Expo CLI automatically splits web bundles into multiple chunks based on async imports in production. This feature requires `@expo/metro-runtime` to be installed and imported somewhere in the entry bundle (available by default in Expo Router).

Shared dependencies of async bundles are merged into a single chunk to reduce the number of requests. For example, if you have two async bundles that import `lodash`, then the library is merged into a single initial chunk.

The chunk splitting heuristic cannot be customized. For example:

`math.js`

`index.js`

```js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

```js
import '@expo/metro-runtime';

// This will be split into a separate chunk.
import('./math').then(math => {
  console.log(math.add(1, 2));
});
```

When you run `npx expo export -p web`, the bundles are split into multiple files, and the entry bundle is added to the main HTML file. `@expo/metro-runtime` adds the runtime code that loads and evaluates the async bundles.

## Source map debug ID

If a bundle is exported with an external source map, a [**Debug ID**](https://sentry.engineering/blog/the-case-for-debug-ids) annotation will be added to the end of the file, along with a matching `debugId` in the source map for corresponding the files together. If no source maps are exported, or inline source maps are used then this annotation will not be added.

```js
// <all source code>

//# debugId=<deterministic chunk hash>
```

The associated `*.js.map` or `*.hbc.map` source map will be a JSON file containing an equivalent `debugId` property. The `debugId` will be injected before hermes bytecode generation to ensure matching in all cases.

The `debugId` is a deterministic hash of the bundle's contents without the external bundle splitting references. This is the same value used to create a chunks filename but formatted as a UUID. For example, `431b98e2-c997-4975-a3d9-2987710abd44`.

`@expo/metro-config` injects `debugId` during `npx expo export` and `npx expo export:embed`. Any additional optimization steps in `npx expo export:embed` like Hermes bytecode generation will need to have the `debugId` injected manually.

## Metro require runtime

You can optionally enable a custom Metro `require` implementation with the environment variable `EXPO_USE_METRO_REQUIRE=1`. This runtime has the following features:

-   String module IDs that are human-readable and make missing module errors easier to follow.
-   Deterministic IDs that are the same between runs and across modules (required for React Server Components in development).
-   Removed support for legacy RAM bundles.

## Magic import comments

> Available from SDK 52 on all platforms.

Server environments such as Workers, and Node.js support import arbitrary files at runtime, so you may want to keep `import` syntax in-tact instead of using Metro's require system. You can opt-out dynamic imports with the `/* @metro-ignore */` comment in `import()` statements.

```js
// Manually ensure `./my-module.js` is included in the correct spot relative to the module.
const myModule = await import(/* @metro-ignore */ './my-module.js');
```

Expo CLI will skip the `./my-module.js` dependency and assume that the developer has manually added it to the output bundle. Internally, this is used for exporting custom server code that dynamically switches between files based on the request. Avoid using this syntax for native bundles since `import()` is generally not available in React Native with Hermes enabled.

Many React libraries shipped the Webpack `/* webpackIgnore: true */` comment to achieve similar behavior. To bridge the gap, we've also added support for Webpack's comment but recommend using the Metro equivalent in your app.

## ES Module resolution

> This sections applies from SDK 53 on all platforms.

Metro resolves ES Module `import` and CommonJS `require` with separate resolution strategies.

Previously, Metro applied the classic Node.js module resolution strategy (which matches Node.js versions before v12), with some additions to support ES Modules. In this resolution strategy, Metro resolves modules from `node_modules`, JS files, optionally while omitting extensions, such as `.js`, and uses `package.json` fields such as `main`, `module`, and `react-native`.

Now, with the modern ES Modules resolution strategy, Metro instead resolves modules from `node_modules`, then matches different `package.json` fields, such as `exports`, [a nested map of sub-paths a package exposes](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports), and `main`.

Depending on how a package is imported, one of these two resolution strategies will be used. Typically, a file that is imported with `import` from a Node module (rather than `require`), will use the ES Modules resolution strategy, and fall back on regular classic Node.js resolution. A file that wasn't resolved with ES Modules resolution or has been imported with CommonJS `require` will use the classic resolution strategy.

### `package.json:exports`

When performing ES Modules resolution, Metro will look at the `package.json:exports` conditions map. This is a mapping of import subpaths and conditions to files in the Node module package.

For example, a package that always exposes an **index.js** file, and matches Metro's classic CommonJS module resolution, may specify a map with the `default` condition.

```json
{
  "exports": {
    "default": "./index.js"
  }
}
```

However, a package providing both a CommonJS and ES Modules entrypoint may provide a mapping with the `import` and `require` conditions.

```json
{
  "exports": {
    "import": "./index.mjs",
    "require": "./index.cjs"
  }
}
```

By default, Metro will match different conditions depending on the platform and whether the resolution has started from a CommonJS `require` call, or an ES Modules `import` statement and will change the condition accordingly.

For native platforms, the condition `react-native` is added, for web exports, the `browser` condition is added, and for server exports (such as API routes or React Server functions), the `node`, `react-server`, and `workerd` conditions are added. These conditions aren't matched in the order they're defined in. Instead, they're matched against the order of properties in the `package.json:exports` map.

TypeScript performs ES Module resolution separately from Metro and will also respect `package.json:exports` maps, when its `compilerOptions.moduleResolution` configuration option has either been set to `"bundler"` (which matches Metro's behavior more closely) or to `"node16"` / `"nodenext"`. TypeScript will however also match the `types` condition. As such, types may not resolve properly when a package doesn't put the `types` condition first in its exports map.

Since an exports map may contain subpaths, a package import may not have to match a file in the package's modules folder any longer, but may be a "redirected" import. Importing `'package/submodule'` may match a different file than **node_modules/package/submodule.js** if it's specified in `package.json:exports`.

```json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": "./index.js",
    "./submodule": "./submodule/submodule.js"
  }
}
```

If you're encountering packages that are incompatible or unprepared for the new ES Modules resolution strategy, you may be able to resolve problems by patching its `package.json` file and add or correct its `package.json:exports` conditions map. However, it's also possible to prevent Metro from using `package.json:exports` maps in its resolution by disabling the `unstable_enablePackageExports` option.

```js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

/** @type {import('expo/metro-config').MetroConfig} */
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

config.resolver.unstable_enablePackageExports = false;

module.exports = config;
```

## Asset imports

When assets are imported, a virtual module is created to represent the data required for importing the asset.

On native platforms, an asset will be a numeric ID: `1`, `2`, `3`, and so on, which can be looked up using `require("@react-native/assets-registry/registry").getAssetByID(<NUMBER>)`. On web and server platforms, the asset will change depending on the file type. If the file is an image, then the asset will be `{ uri: string, width?: number, height?: number }`, otherwise the asset will be a `string` representing the remote URL for the asset. As of SDK 55, you can use `String(asset)` to get the public URL of any asset on web, this excludes React Server Component environments which cannot contain a `toString` function.

The assets can be used as follows:

```jsx
import { Image } from 'react-native';

import asset from './img.png';

function Demo() {
  return <Image source={asset} />;
}
```

In API routes, you can always assume the type of the asset will not be a number:

```js
import asset from './img.png';

export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const ImageData = await fetch(
    new URL(
      // Access the asset URI.
      asset.uri,
      // Append to the current request URL origin.
      req.url
    )
  ).then(res => res.arrayBuffer());

  return new Response(ImageData, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'image/png',
    },
  });
}
```

## Web workers

> This feature is alpha and subject to breaking changes.

```ts
new Worker(new URL('./worker', window.location.href));
```

Expo Metro has experimental web worker support. This feature is currently web-only and does not work on native, usage on native will trigger an error "Property 'Worker' doesn't exist".

Web workers can be used to offload work to a separate thread on web, allowing the main thread to remain responsive. This is useful for computationally expensive tasks, such as image processing, cryptography, or other tasks that would otherwise block the main thread.

Workers can be generated inline using `Blob`, but sometimes you may want to leverage modern features like TypeScript or importing other modules.

Web workers depend on Expo bundle splitting support, which means you need to either use Expo Router or install and import `@expo/metro-runtime`. You also cannot use the environment `EXPO_NO_METRO_LAZY=1` with web workers.

Consider the following example of a worker that doubles a number:

```ts
self.onmessage = ({ data }) => {
  const result = data * 2; // Example: double the number
  self.postMessage(result);
};
```

This worker file can be imported as a `Worker` in the main app:

```ts
// worker is of type `Worker`
const worker = new Worker(new URL('./worker', window.location.href));

worker.onmessage = ({ data }) => {
  console.log(`Worker responded: ${data}`);
};

worker.postMessage(5);
```

Behind the scenes, Expo CLI is generating code like this:

```ts
const worker = new Worker(
  new URL('/worker.bundle?platform=web&dev=true&etc', window.location.href)
);
```

The generated bundle URL changes based on development/production to ensure the worker is loaded and bundled correctly. Unlike traditional bundle splitting, a worker file needs to contain its own copy of all modules and cannot depend on common modules in the main bundle.

The native API `Worker` is traditionally unavailable in React Native and not provided by the Expo SDK, so even though this bundling feature technically works for all platforms, it's only useful on web. You could theoretically write a native Expo module that polyfills the `Worker` API if you want to support native platforms too. Alternatively, you can use the "worklet" API in React Native Reanimated to offload work to a separate thread on native.

Alternatively, you can import Workers using the public path by first putting a transformed JS file in the **public** directory, then referencing it in the worker import with a variable:

```ts
// Will avoid the transform and use the public path directly.
const worker = new Worker('/worker.js');

// The variable breaks the transform causing the literal path to be used instead of the transformed path.
const path = '/worker.js';

const anotherWorker = new Worker(new URL(path, window.location.href));
```

Using a variable in the `Worker` constructor is not supported for bundling. To inspect the internal URL, you may use the internal syntax `require.unstable_resolveWorker('./path/to/worker.js')` to get the URL fragment.

## Bare workflow setup

> This guide is versioned and will need to be revisited when upgrading/downgrading Expo. Alternatively, use [Expo Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild) for fully automated setup.

Projects that don't use [Expo Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild) must configure native files to ensure the Expo Metro config is always used to bundle the project.

These modifications are meant to replace `npx react-native bundle` and `npx react-native start` with `npx expo export:embed` and `npx expo start` respectively.

### metro.config.js

Ensure the **metro.config.js** extends `expo/metro-config`:

```js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

module.exports = config;
```

### `android/app/build.gradle`

The Android **app/build.gradle** must be configured to use Expo CLI for production bundling. Modify the `react` config object:

### `ios/<Project>.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

In your **ios/<Project>.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj** file, replace the following scripts:

#### "Start Packager" script

Remove the **"Start Packager"** script. The dev server must be started with `npx expo` before/after running the app.

#### "Bundle React Native code and images" script

Alternatively, in the Xcode project, select the **"Bundle React Native code and images"** build phase and add the following modifications:

> You can set `CLI_PATH`, `BUNDLE_COMMAND`, and `ENTRY_FILE` environment variables to overwrite these defaults.

### Custom entry file

By default, React Native only supports using a root `index.js` file as the entry file (or platform-specific variation like `index.ios.js`). Expo projects allow using any entry file, but this requires addition bare setup.

#### Development

Development mode entry files can be enabled by using the [`expo-dev-client`](/versions/latest/sdk/dev-client) package. Alternatively you can add the following configuration:

#### Production

In your **ios/<Project>.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj** file, replace the **"Bundle React Native code and images"** script to set `$ENTRY_FILE` according using Metro:

The Android **app/build.gradle** must be configured to use Metro module resolution to find the root entry file. Modify the `react` config object:

title: package.json
description: A reference for Expo-specific properties that can be used in the package.json file.

# package.json

A reference for Expo-specific properties that can be used in the package.json file.

**package.json** is a JSON file that contains the metadata for a JavaScript project. This is a reference to Expo-specific properties that can be used in the **package.json** file.

## `install.exclude`

The following commands perform a version check for the libraries installed in a project and give a warning when a library's version is different from the version recommended by Expo:

-   `npx expo start` and `npx expo-doctor`
-   `npx expo install` (when installing a new version of that library or using `--check` or `--fix` options)

By specifying the library under the `install.exclude` array in the **package.json** file, you can exclude it from the version checks:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "install": {
      "exclude": ["expo-updates", "expo-splash-screen"]
    }
  }
}
```

## `autolinking`

Allows configuring module resolution behavior by using `autolinking` property in **package.json**.

For complete reference, see [Autolinking configuration](/modules/autolinking#configuration).

## `doctor`

Allows configuring the behavior of the [`npx expo-doctor`](/develop/tools#expo-doctor) command.

### `reactNativeDirectoryCheck`

By default, Expo Doctor validates your project's packages against the [React Native directory](https://reactnative.directory/). This check throws a warning with a list of packages that are not included in the React Native Directory.

You can customize this check by adding the following configuration in your project's **package.json** file:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "doctor": {
      "reactNativeDirectoryCheck": {
        "enabled": true,
        "exclude": ["/foo/", "bar"],
        "listUnknownPackages": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

By default, the check is enabled and unknown packages are listed.

### `appConfigFieldsNotSyncedCheck`

Expo Doctor checks if your project includes native project directories such as **android** or **ios**. If these directories exist but are not listed in your **.gitignore** or [**.easignore**](/build-reference/easignore) files, Expo Doctor verifies the presence of an app config file. If this file exists, it means your project is configured to use [Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild).

When the **android** or **ios** directories are present, EAS Build does not sync app config properties to the native projects. Expo Doctor throws a warning if these conditions are true.

You can disable or enable this check by adding the following configuration to your project's **package.json** file:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "doctor": {
      "appConfigFieldsNotSyncedCheck": {
        "enabled": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Reference

The Expo SDK provides access to device and system functionality such as contacts, camera, gyroscope, GPS location, and so on, in the form of packages. You can install any Expo SDK package using the `npx expo install` command. For example, three different packages are installed using the following command:

```sh
npx expo install expo-camera expo-contacts expo-sensors
```

After installing one or more packages, you can import them into your JavaScript code:

```js
import { CameraView } from 'expo-camera';
import * as Contacts from 'expo-contacts';
import { Gyroscope } from 'expo-sensors';
```

This allows you to write [`Contacts.getContactsAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/contacts#contactsgetcontactsasynccontactquery) and read the contacts from the device, read the gyroscope sensor to detect device movement, or start the phone's camera and take photos.

## All Expo SDK packages work in any React Native app

Expo apps are React Native apps, so all Expo SDK packages work in any React Native app with the `expo` package installed and configured. The easiest way to create a React Native app with support for Expo SDK packages is to use `create-expo-app`. However, you can also add Expo SDK support to an existing React Native app with the `npx install-expo-modules` command.

```sh
npx create-expo-app my-app --template bare-minimum
```

[Install Expo SDK packages in existing React Native apps](/bare/installing-expo-modules) — Learn more about configuring projects created with npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init to Expo SDK packages. — npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init

[Use libraries](/workflow/using-libraries) — Learn how to install Expo SDK packages in your project.

## Using pre-release versions

New Expo SDK versions are released three times each year. Between these releases, we publish pre-release versions of the `expo` package and all of the Expo SDK packages. Pre-releases are not considered stable and should only be used if you are comfortable with the risk of encountering bugs or other issues.

### Canary releases

Canary releases represent a snapshot of the state of the `main` branch at the time they are published. Canary package versions include `-canary` in the name, along with the date and commit hash, such as `55.0.0-canary-20260121-a63c0dd`. To install the latest canary release:

```sh
npm install expo@canary && npx expo install --fix
```

You can often use pre-release versions of individual packages with stable releases of the Expo SDK. There may occasionally be incompatibilities or other issues that arise in canary-quality releases. You may want to [silence dependency validation warnings](/more/expo-cli#configuring-dependency-validation) if you opt in to the canary package and once you have verified that it works well for your use cases.

### Beta releases

Before each Expo SDK release, we publish beta versions of the `expo` package and all of the Expo SDK packages. Beta releases are considered much more stable than canary releases, and we encourage developers to try them out on their apps and share their feedback. Beta releases use the `beta` tag on npm and follow the instructions in the related [changelog](https://expo.dev/changelog) post.

## Each Expo SDK version depends on a React Native version

| Expo SDK version | React Native version | React version | React Native Web version | React Native TV version | Minimum Node.js version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 55.0.0 | 0.83 | 19.2.0 | 0.21.0 | 0.83-stable | 20.19.x |
| 54.0.0 | 0.81 | 19.1.0 | 0.21.0 | 0.81-stable | 20.19.x |
| 53.0.0 | 0.79 | 19.0.0 | 0.20.0 | 0.79-stable | 20.18.x |

### Additional information

Expo SDK policy for tracking React Native releases

-   Expo SDK versions are released three times each year, and each Expo SDK release targets a single React Native version. This is typically the latest stable version at the time of the release.
-   The release cadence of React Native has varied over its history and it is currently on pace for six releases in 2025. While on this cadence, you can expect that there will be an Expo SDK version for every second React Native release.
-   Pre-release versions of the upcoming Expo SDK will include support for the latest version of React Native quickly, usually the same day it is released. A member of the Expo SDK team works on the React Native releases team for each release, and is responsible for continuously updating the React Native version in the Expo repository, verifying compatibility, and reporting regressions back to the team at Meta.

Why not release a new Expo SDK version immediately for every React Native release?

At Expo, we have found that releasing three major version provides a good balance of stability and innovation for developers depending on our open source tools. Expo and Meta work closely together on releases, and we will keep improving our processes to get the latest Expo and React Native features to you as quickly as possible.

What if I need a change from the latest React Native version and it's not yet in an Expo SDK release?

We work closely with the team at Meta to ensure that any urgent fixes are included in the React Native version used by the latest Expo SDK. If your issue won't be cherrypicked into an existing release because it is more niche, or it involves a breaking change, then you have two options:

1.  Use [`patch-package`](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package) to pull in the fix.
2.  Use a [pre-release version of the Expo SDK](/versions/latest#using-pre-release-versions). An ([example](https://expo.dev/changelog/react-native-78)).

Can I use an older version of React Native with the latest Expo SDK?

Packages in the Expo SDK are intended to support the target React Native version for that SDK. Typically, they will not support older versions of React Native, but they may. When a new version of React Native is released, the latest versions of the Expo SDK packages are typically updated to support it. However, this may take weeks or more, depending on the extent of the changes in the release.

## Support for Android and iOS versions

Each version of Expo SDK supports a minimum OS version of Android and iOS. For Android, the `compileSdkVersion` is defined which tells the [Gradle](https://developer.android.com/studio/build) which Android SDK version to use to compile the app. This also means that you can use the Android API features included in that SDK version and from the previous versions. For iOS, the [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/news/upcoming-requirements/) tells the minimum Xcode SDK version to use to compile the app.

| Expo SDK version | Android version | `compileSdkVersion` | `targetSdkVersion` | iOS version | Xcode version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 55.0.0 | 7+ | 36 | 36 | 15.1+ | 26.2+ |
| 54.0.0 | 7+ | 36 | 36 | 15.1+ | 16.1+ |
| 53.0.0 | 7+ | 35 | 35 | 15.1+ | 16.0+ |

When deciding whether to upgrade your Expo SDK version, consider both Expo's SDK version and app store submission requirements, as described in the above table. Google Play Store and Apple App Store periodically increase their minimum required OS versions and API levels, which are required for new app submissions. Expo has no control over the app store requirements, and you should check [Google](https://developer.android.com/studio/build) and [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/news/upcoming-requirements/) for the current store submission requirements.

# Expo Accelerometer

A library that provides access to the device's accelerometer sensor.
Android, iOS (device only), Web, Included in Expo Go

`Accelerometer` from `expo-sensors` provides access to the device accelerometer sensor(s) and associated listeners to respond to changes in acceleration in three-dimensional space, meaning any movement or vibration.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-sensors
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, TouchableOpacity, View } from 'react-native';
import { Accelerometer } from 'expo-sensors';

export default function App() {
  const [{ x, y, z }, setData] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    z: 0,
  });
  const [subscription, setSubscription] = useState(null);

  const _slow = () => Accelerometer.setUpdateInterval(1000);
  const _fast = () => Accelerometer.setUpdateInterval(16);

  const _subscribe = () => {
    setSubscription(Accelerometer.addListener(setData));
  };

  const _unsubscribe = () => {
    subscription && subscription.remove();
    setSubscription(null);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    _subscribe();
    return () => _unsubscribe();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Accelerometer: (in gs where 1g = 9.81 m/s^2)</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>x: {x}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>y: {y}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>z: {z}</Text>
      <View style={styles.buttonContainer}>
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={subscription ? _unsubscribe : _subscribe} style={styles.button}>
          <Text>{subscription ? 'On' : 'Off'}</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={_slow} style={[styles.button, styles.middleButton]}>
          <Text>Slow</Text>

```

## API

```js
import { Accelerometer } from 'expo-sensors';
```

## Classes

### `Accelerometer`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Type: Class extends [DeviceSensor](/versions/latest/sdk/sensors)<[AccelerometerMeasurement](#accelerometermeasurement)\>

A base class for subscribable sensors. The events emitted by this class are measurements specified by the parameter type `Measurement`.

Accelerometer Methods

### `addListener(listener)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listener` | Listener<[AccelerometerMeasurement](#accelerometermeasurement)\> | A callback that is invoked when an accelerometer update is available. When invoked, the listener is provided a single argument that is an `AccelerometerMeasurement` object. |

  

Subscribe for updates to the accelerometer.

Returns: `EventSubscription`

A subscription that you can call `remove()` on when you would like to unsubscribe the listener.

### `getListenerCount()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Returns the registered listeners count.

Returns: `number`

### `getPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Checks user's permissions for accessing sensor.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

### `hasListeners()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Returns boolean which signifies if sensor has any listeners registered.

Returns: `boolean`

### `isAvailableAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

> You should always check the sensor availability before attempting to use it.

Returns whether the accelerometer is enabled on the device.

On mobile web, you must first invoke `Accelerometer.requestPermissionsAsync()` in a user interaction (i.e. touch event) before you can use this module. If the `status` is not equal to `granted` then you should inform the end user that they may have to open settings.

On **web** this starts a timer and waits to see if an event is fired. This should predict if the iOS device has the **device orientation** API disabled in **Settings > Safari > Motion & Orientation Access**. Some devices will also not fire if the site isn't hosted with **HTTPS** as `DeviceMotion` is now considered a secure API. There is no formal API for detecting the status of `DeviceMotion` so this API can sometimes be unreliable on web.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

A promise that resolves to a `boolean` denoting the availability of the accelerometer.

### `removeAllListeners()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Removes all registered listeners.

Returns: `void`

> **Deprecated:** use subscription.remove() instead.

### `removeSubscription(subscription)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `subscription` | `EventSubscription` |

  

Returns: `void`

### `requestPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing sensor.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

### `setUpdateInterval(intervalMs)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intervalMs` | `number` | Desired interval in milliseconds between sensor updates. Starting from Android 12 (API level 31), the system has a 200Hz limit for each sensor updates. |

  

Set the sensor update interval.

Returns: `void`

## Interfaces

### `Subscription`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

A subscription object that allows to conveniently remove an event listener from the emitter.

Subscription Methods

### `remove()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Removes an event listener for which the subscription has been created. After calling this function, the listener will no longer receive any events from the emitter.

Returns: `void`

## Types

### `AccelerometerMeasurement`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Each of these keys represents the acceleration along that particular axis in g-force (measured in `g`s).

A `g` is a unit of gravitational force equal to that exerted by the earth’s gravitational field (`9.81 m/s^2`).

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| timestamp | `number` | Timestamp of the measurement in seconds. |
| x | `number` | Value of `g`s device reported in X axis. |
| y | `number` | Value of `g`s device reported in Y axis. |
| z | `number` | Value of `g`s device reported in Z axis. |

### `PermissionExpiration`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Literal Type: `union`

Permission expiration time. Currently, all permissions are granted permanently.

Acceptable values are: `'never'` | `number`

### `PermissionResponse`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

An object obtained by permissions get and request functions.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

| expires | `PermissionExpiration` | Determines time when the permission expires. |
| granted | `boolean` | A convenience boolean that indicates if the permission is granted. |
| status | `PermissionStatus` | Determines the status of the permission. |

## Enums

### `PermissionStatus`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

#### `DENIED`

`PermissionStatus.DENIED = "denied"`

User has denied the permission.

#### `GRANTED`

`PermissionStatus.GRANTED = "granted"`

User has granted the permission.

#### `UNDETERMINED`

`PermissionStatus.UNDETERMINED = "undetermined"`

User hasn't granted or denied the permission yet.

# Expo AgeRange

A library that provides access to age range information using Play Age Signals API on Android and Declared Age Range framework on iOS.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

> **This library is currently in alpha and will frequently experience breaking changes.**

`expo-age-range` provides access to user age range information. It uses Google's [Play Age Signals API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/age-signals/use-age-signals-api) on Android and Apple's [Declared Age Range framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/declaredagerange/) on iOS.

This library allows you to request age range information from your app users to help you comply with age-appropriate content regulations (such as in [Texas, USA](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=btkirlj8)) and provide age-appropriate experiences in your app.

### Limitations

We strongly recommend testing the functionality on a real device, as simulator runtimes may not work as expected.

On Android, the Play Age Signals API (beta) may throw an exception until January 1, 2026, as per the [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/google/play/age-signals/use-age-signals-api#integrate-play-age-signals). From January 1, the API will return live responses.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-age-range
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

### Setup iOS project

To use the age range API on iOS, you need to build your project with Xcode 26.0 or later. The `com.apple.developer.declared-age-range` entitlement is required. Add it to your [app config](/versions/latest/sdk/config/app) file:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "entitlements": {
        "com.apple.developer.declared-age-range": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

For existing React Native projects, add the entitlement to your project's **ios/[app]/[app].entitlements** file:

```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.declared-age-range</key>
<true/>
```

## Usage

```tsx
import * as AgeRange from 'expo-age-range';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  const [result, setResult] = useState<AgeRange.AgeRangeResponse | { error: string } | null>(null);

  const requestAgeRange = async () => {
    try {
      const ageRange = await AgeRange.requestAgeRangeAsync({
        threshold1: 10,
        threshold2: 13,
        threshold3: 18,
      });
      setResult(ageRange);

## API

```ts
import * as AgeRange from 'expo-age-range';
```

## Methods

### `AgeRange.requestAgeRangeAsync(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS 26.0+.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options` | [AgeRangeRequest](#agerangerequest) |

  

Prompts the user to share their age range with the app. Responses may be cached by the OS for future requests.

Returns: `Promise<agerangeresponse>`

A promise that resolves with user's age range response, or rejects with an error. The user needs to be signed in on the device to get a valid response. When not supported (earlier than iOS 26 and web), the call returns `lowerBound: 18`, which is equivalent to the response of an adult user.

## Types

### `AgeRangeRequest`

Supported platforms: iOS.

Options for requesting age range information from the user.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| threshold1 | `number` | The required minimum age for your app. |
| threshold2(optional) | `number` | An optional additional minimum age for your app. |
| threshold3(optional) | `number` | An optional additional minimum age for your app. |

### `AgeRangeResponse`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Response containing the user's age range information.

Contains age boundaries and platform-specific metadata.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| activeParentalControls(optional) | `string[]` | Supported platforms: iOS. List of parental controls enabled and shared as a part of age range declaration. |
| ageRangeDeclaration(optional) | `'selfDeclared' | 'guardianDeclared'` | Supported platforms: iOS. Indicates whether the age range was declared by the user themselves or someone else (parent, guardian, or Family Organizer in a Family Sharing group). |
| installId(optional) | `string` | Supported platforms: Android. An ID assigned to supervised user installs by Google Play, used to notify you of revoked app approval. |
| lowerBound(optional) | `number` | The lower limit of the person’s age range. |
| mostRecentApprovalDate(optional) | `number` | Supported platforms: Android. The effective date (timestamp) of the most recent significant change that was approved. |
| upperBound(optional) | `number` | The upper limit of the person’s age range. |
| userStatus(optional) | `'VERIFIED' | 'SUPERVISED' | 'SUPERVISED_APPROVAL_PENDING' | 'SUPERVISED_APPROVAL_DENIED' | 'DECLARED' | 'UNKNOWN'` | Supported platforms: Android. The user's age verification or supervision status. |

## Error codes

Available in the `code` property of any error thrown by the native module. For Android-specific error codes, see "Handle API error codes" in [Use Play Age Signals API docs](https://developer.android.com/google/play/age-signals/use-age-signals-api#handle-api-errors).

| Code | Platform | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ERR_AGE_RANGE_USER_DECLINED` | iOS | User declined to share their age range. |
| `ERR_AGE_RANGE_NOT_AVAILABLE` | iOS | Age range not available. The most likely cause is that user is not signed in to their Apple account on the device. |

# AppIntegrity

A library that provides access to Google's Play Integrity API on Android and Apple's App Attest service on iOS.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

> **This library is currently in alpha and will frequently experience breaking changes.**

`@expo/app-integrity` provides APIs to help ensure your backend resources are accessed only by legitimate installations of your app running on genuine devices. It uses Google's [Play Integrity APIs](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity) on Android and Apple's [App Attest service](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/establishing-your-app-s-integrity) on iOS to verify app authenticity, helping prevent unauthorized clients, modified apps, or automated scripts from making requests to your server.

Generally, `@expo/app-integrity` helps your server tell the difference between:

-   Your **real app** running on a **real device**
-   Anything else (modified apps, scripts, emulators)

It does this by using the platform-recommended app attestation services.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/app-integrity
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage on Android

`@expo/app-integrity` uses Play Integrity's [Standard request flow](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/standard) for integrity checks.

### Configuration

Refer to the [Play Integrity setup guide](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/setup#set-integrity-responses) for instructions to enable integrity APIs in your app.

### Prepare the integrity token provider (one time)

You need to prepare the integrity token provider before you make integrity check requests. You can do this when your app launches or in the background before the integrity check is needed.

```js
import * as AppIntegrity from '@expo/app-integrity';

const cloudProjectNumber = 'your-cloud-project-number';
await AppIntegrity.prepareIntegrityTokenProviderAsync(cloudProjectNumber);
```

### Request an integrity token (on demand)

Whenever your app makes a server request that you want to check is genuine, you request an integrity token and send it to your app's backend server for decryption and verification. Then, your backend server can determine how to act.

```js
const requestHash = '2cp24z...';
const result = await AppIntegrity.requestIntegrityCheckAsync(requestHash);
```

Before calling [`requestIntegrityCheckAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/app-integrity#appintegrityrequestintegritycheckasyncrequesthash), ensure that [`prepareIntegrityTokenProviderAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/app-integrity#appintegrityprepareintegritytokenproviderasynccloudprojectnumber) was called successfully.

In this example, `requestHash` is a hash unique to the specific user action being verified. You can call [`requestIntegrityCheckAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/app-integrity#appintegrityprepareintegritytokenproviderasynccloudprojectnumber) multiple times with different hashes for different user actions.

On success, send the result to your server for verification.

> **Note**: If your app uses the same token provider for too long, the token provider can expire which results in the `ERR_APP_INTEGRITY_PROVIDER_INVALID` error on the next token request. You should handle this error by requesting a new provider by calling `prepareIntegrityTokenProviderAsync` again.

### Decrypt and verify the integrity verdict

Refer [Play Integrity's guide](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/standard#decrypt-and) to verify the integrity token in your server.

### Additional resources

-   [Google Pay Integrity documentation](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/overview): Refer to Google's official guide to understand the APIs and verification flow that power `@expo/app-integrity`.
    
-   [Play Integrity Standard request flow](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/standard): This page describes making standard API requests for integrity verdicts, which are supported on Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher. You can make a standard API request for an integrity verdict whenever your app is making a server call to check whether the interaction is genuine.
    
-   [About Integrity verdicts](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/verdicts): The integrity verdict communicates information about the validity of devices, apps, and accounts. Your app's server can use the resulting payload in a decrypted, verified verdict to determine how best to proceed with a particular action or request in your app.
    
-   [Handling error codes](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/reference/com/google/android/play/core/integrity/model/StandardIntegrityErrorCode): If your app makes a Play Integrity API request and the call fails, your app receives an error code. These errors can happen for various reasons, such as environmental issues like a weak network connection, problems with your API integration, or malicious activity and active attacks.
    

## Usage on iOS

### Configuration

In Xcode, go to **Signing & Capabilities**, click **\+ Capability**, add **App Attest**. Xcode will automatically add the required entitlement to your app.

> **Note**: To use the App Attest service, your app must have an App ID that you register on the Apple Developer website.

For verification logic on your server, see [Validating apps that connect to your server](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating-apps-that-connect-to-your-server).

### Check if the device supports app attestation

Not all devices can use the App Attest service, so it's important to have your app run a compatibility check before accessing the service. If the user's app doesn't pass the compatibility check, gracefully bypass the service. You can check for availability by reading the `isSupported` property.

```js
import * as AppIntegrity from '@expo/app-integrity';

if (AppIntegrity.isSupported) {
  // Perform key generation and attestation.
}
// Continue with your server API access.
```

> **Note**: App Attest is not supported on iOS Simulator.

> Most app extensions don't support App Attest. Generally, when executing code in these extensions, bypass key generation and attestation, even if the `isSupported` method property is `true`. The only app extensions that support App Attest are watchOS extensions in watchOS 9 or later. For these extensions, you can use the results from `isSupported` to indicate whether your WatchKit extension bypasses attestation.

### Create a key pair

For each user account on each device running your app, generate a unique, hardware-based, cryptographic key pair by calling the `generateKey` method.

```js
const keyId = await AppIntegrity.generateKeyAsync();
```

On success, the method returns a key identifier (`keyId`) that you use later to access the key. Record the identifier in persistent storage because there's no way to use the key without the identifier and no way to get the identifier later. The device automatically stores the associated private key in the Secure Enclave, from where the App Attest service can use it to create signatures, but from where no process can ever directly read or modify it, ensuring its security.

> If you create a key pair in an App Clip, use the same key pair in the corresponding app. To support this, be sure to store the identifier in a shared container accessible from your full app. See Expo’s guide on sharing a database between apps/extensions using [expo-sqlite](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite/#sharing-a-database-between-appsextensions-ios), or use React Native MMKV's [App Groups / extensions](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv?tab=readme-ov-file#app-groups-or-extensions) shared storage to persist the identifier across both targets.

Don't reuse a key among multiple users on a device because this weakens security protections. In particular, it becomes hard to detect an attack that uses a single compromised device to serve multiple remote users running a compromised version of your app. For more information, see [Assessing fraud risk](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/assessing-fraud-risk).

### Get a challenge from your server

Request a unique, one-time challenge from your server. This challenge will be embedded in the attestation step below, ensuring it can't be reused by an attacker. The challenge should be at least 16 bytes long to provide enough entropy so that guessing it is infeasible.

### Certify the key pairs as valid

Pass the `keyId` alongwith the challenge from your server created in the previous steps in `attestKey` method as shown below:

```js
const attestationObject = await AppIntegrity.attestKeyAsync(keyId, challenge);
```

On success, send the received `attestationObject` and the `keyId` to your server for verification.

If the method returns `ERR_APP_INTEGRITY_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE` error, try attestation again later with the same key. For any other error, discard the key identifier and create a new key when you want to try again.

> If your app already has millions of daily active users and you want to start calling the `attestKey` method to initiate attestation from your app, review the [Preparing to use the app attest service](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeviceCheck/preparing-to-use-the-app-attest-service) for guidance on safely ramping your users.

Your server deems the app instance to be valid if it can successfully verify the attestation object. In this case, be sure to persistently store the key identifier — not the attestation object — in your app to sign server requests in the future.

### Generate assertions on sensitive requests

After successfully verifying a key's attestation, your server can require the app to assert its legitimacy for any or all future server requests. The app does this by signing the request. In the app, obtain a unique, one-time challenge from the server. You use a challenge here, like for attestation, to avoid replay attacks.

```js
const challenge = 'A string from your server';
const request = {
  action: 'getGameLevel',
  levelId: '1234',
  challenge: challenge,
};
const assertion = await AppIntegrity.generateAssertionAsync(keyId, JSON.stringify(request));
```

On success, pass the assertion object, along with the client data, to the server. If the assertion object fails verification, it's your responsibility to decide how to handle the request.

There's no restriction on the number of assertions that you can make with a key. Nevertheless, you typically reserve assertions for requests made at sensitive moments in your app's life cycle, like when the app downloads premium content.

### Start over on reinstallation

The keys that you generate remain valid through regular app updates, but don't survive app reinstallation, device migration, or restoration of a device from a backup. In these cases, you need to start the process from the beginning and generate a new key. Try to limit new key generation to only these events, or to the addition of new users. Keeping the key count low on a device helps when trying to detect certain kinds of fraud.

# Expo AppleAuthentication

A library that provides Sign-in with Apple capability for iOS.
iOS, tvOS, Included in Expo Go

`expo-apple-authentication` provides Apple authentication for iOS. It does not yet support Android or web.

Any app that includes third-party authentication options **must** provide Apple authentication as an option to comply with App Store Review guidelines. For more information, see Apple authentication on the [Sign In with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/) website.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-apple-authentication
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-apple-authentication` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Setup iOS project

To enable the **Sign In with Apple** capability in your app, set the [`ios.usesAppleSignIn`](/versions/latest/config/app#usesapplesignin) property to `true` in your project's app config:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "usesAppleSignIn": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Example app.json with config plugin

Running [EAS Build](/build/introduction) locally will use [iOS capabilities signing](/build-reference/ios-capabilities) to enable the required capabilities before building.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": ["expo-apple-authentication"]
  }
}
```

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

Apps that don't use [EAS Build](/build/introduction) must [manually configure](/build-reference/ios-capabilities#manual-setup) the **Apple Sign In** capability for their bundle identifier.

If you enable the **Apple Sign In** capability through the [Apple Developer Console](/build-reference/ios-capabilities#apple-developer-console), then be sure to add the following entitlements in your **ios/[app]/[app].entitlements** file:

```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.applesignin</key>
<array>
  <string>Default</string>
</array>
```

Also, set `CFBundleAllowMixedLocalizations` to `true` in your **ios/[app]/Info.plist** to ensure the sign-in button uses the device locale.

## Usage

```jsx
import * as AppleAuthentication from 'expo-apple-authentication';
import { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <AppleAuthentication.AppleAuthenticationButton
        buttonType={AppleAuthentication.AppleAuthenticationButtonType.SIGN_IN}
        buttonStyle={AppleAuthentication.AppleAuthenticationButtonStyle.BLACK}
        cornerRadius={5}
        style={styles.button}
        onPress={async () => {
          try {
            const credential = await AppleAuthentication.signInAsync({
              requestedScopes: [
                AppleAuthentication.AppleAuthenticationScope.FULL_NAME,
                AppleAuthentication.AppleAuthenticationScope.EMAIL,
              ],
            });
            // signed in
          } catch (e) {
            if (e.code === 'ERR_REQUEST_CANCELED') {
              // handle that the user canceled the sign-in flow
            } else {
              // handle other errors
            }
          }
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  button: {
    width: 200,
    height: 44,
  },
});
```

## Development and testing

You can test this library in Expo Go on iOS without following any of the instructions above. However, you'll need to add the config plugin to use this library if you are using EAS Build. When you sign into Expo Go, the identifiers and values you receive will likely be different than what you'll receive in standalone apps.

You can do limited testing of this library on the iOS Simulator. However, not all methods will behave the same as on a device, so we highly recommend testing on a real device when possible while developing.

## Verifying the Response from Apple

Apple's response includes a signed JWT with information about the user. To ensure that the response came from Apple, you can cryptographically verify the signature with Apple's public key, which is published at [https://appleid.apple.com/auth/keys](https://appleid.apple.com/auth/keys). This process is not specific to Expo.

## API

```js
import * as AppleAuthentication from 'expo-apple-authentication';
```

## Component

### `AppleAuthenticationButton`

Supported platforms: iOS, tvOS.

Type: React.Element<[AppleAuthenticationButtonProps](#appleauthenticationbuttonprops)\>

This component displays the proprietary "Sign In with Apple" / "Continue with Apple" button on your screen. The App Store Guidelines require you to use this component to start the authentication process instead of a custom button. Limited customization of the button is available via the provided properties.

You should only attempt to render this if [`AppleAuthentication.isAvailableAsync()`](#appleauthenticationisavailableasync) resolves to `true`. This component will render nothing if it is not available, and you will get a warning in development mode (`__DEV__ === true`).

The properties of this component extend from `View`; however, you should not attempt to set `backgroundColor` or `borderRadius` with the `style` property. This will not work and is against the App Store Guidelines. Instead, you should use the `buttonStyle` property to choose one of the predefined color styles and the `cornerRadius` property to change the border radius of the button.

Make sure to attach height and width via the style props as without these styles, the button will not appear on the screen.

> **See:** [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationappleidbutton) for more details.

AppleAuthenticationButtonProps

### `buttonStyle`

Supported platforms: iOS, tvOS.

Type: [AppleAuthenticationButtonStyle](#appleauthenticationbuttonstyle)

The Apple-defined color scheme to use to display the button.

### `buttonType`

Supported platforms: iOS, tvOS.

Type: [AppleAuthenticationButtonType](#appleauthenticationbuttontype)

The type of button text to display ("Sign In with Apple" vs. "Continue with Apple").

### `cornerRadius`

Supported platforms: iOS, tvOS.

Optional • Type: `number`

The border radius to use when rendering the button. This works similarly to `style.borderRadius` in other Views.

### `onPress`

Supported platforms: iOS, tvOS.

Type: `() => void`

The method to call when the user presses the button. You should call [`AppleAuthentication.signInAsync`](#appleauthenticationisavailableasync) in here.

### `style`

Supported platforms: iOS, tvOS.

Optional • Type: StyleProp<[Omit](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#omittype-keys)<[ViewStyle](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props), 'backgroundColor' | 'borderRadius'\>\>

The custom style to apply to the button. Should not include `backgroundColor` or `borderRadius` properties.

You can request access to the user's full name and email address in this method, which allows you to personalize your UI for signed in users. However, users can deny access to either or both of these options at runtime.

Additionally, you will only receive Apple Authentication Credentials the first time users sign into your app, so you must store it for later use. It's best to store this information either server-side, or using [SecureStore](/versions/latest/sdk/securestore), so that the data persists across app installs. You can use [`AppleAuthenticationCredential.user`](#appleauthenticationcredential) to identify the user, since this remains the same for apps released by the same developer.

Returns: `Promise<appleauthenticationcredential>`

A promise that fulfills with an [`AppleAuthenticationCredential`](#appleauthenticationcredential) object after a successful authentication, and rejects with `ERR_REQUEST_CANCELED` if the user cancels the sign-in operation.

### `AppleAuthentication.signOutAsync(options)`

Supported platforms: iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `options` | [AppleAuthenticationSignOutOptions](#appleauthenticationsignoutoptions) | An [`AppleAuthenticationSignOutOptions`](#appleauthenticationsignoutoptions) object |

  

An operation that ends the authenticated session. Calling this method will show the sign in modal before actually signing the user out.

It is not recommended to use this method to sign out the user as it works counterintuitively. Instead of using this method it is recommended to simply clear all the user's data collected from using [`signInAsync`](#appleauthenticationsigninasyncoptions) or [`refreshAsync`](#appleauthenticationrefreshasyncoptions) methods.

Returns: `Promise<appleauthenticationcredential>`

A promise that fulfills with an [`AppleAuthenticationCredential`](#appleauthenticationcredential) object after a successful authentication, and rejects with `ERR_REQUEST_CANCELED` if the user cancels the sign-out operation.

## Event Subscriptions

### `AppleAuthentication.addRevokeListener(listener)`

Supported platforms: iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `listener` | `() => void` |

  

Returns: `EventSubscription`

## Interfaces

### `Subscription`

Supported platforms: iOS, tvOS.

A subscription object that allows to conveniently remove an event listener from the emitter.

Subscription Methods

### `remove()`

Supported platforms: iOS, tvOS.

Removes an event listener for which the subscription has been created. After calling this function, the listener will no longer receive any events from the emitter.

Returns: `void`

## Types

### `AppleAuthenticationCredential`

Supported platforms: iOS, tvOS.

The object type returned from a successful call to [`AppleAuthentication.signInAsync()`](#appleauthenticationsigninasyncoptions), [`AppleAuthentication.refreshAsync()`](#appleauthenticationrefreshasyncoptions), or [`AppleAuthentication.signOutAsync()`](#appleauthenticationsignoutasyncoptions) which contains all of the pertinent user and credential information.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| authorizationCode | `string | null` | A short-lived session token used by your app for proof of authorization when interacting with the app's server counterpart. Unlike `user`, this is ephemeral and will change each session. |
| email | `string | null` | The user's email address. Might not be present if you didn't request the `EMAIL` scope. May also be null if this is not the first time the user has signed into your app. If the user chose to withhold their email address, this field will instead contain an obscured email address with an Apple domain. |
| fullName | [AppleAuthenticationFullName](#appleauthenticationfullname) | null | The user's name. May be `null` or contain `null` values if you didn't request the `FULL_NAME` scope, if the user denied access, or if this is not the first time the user has signed into your app. |

title: Asset
description: A universal library that allows downloading assets and using them with other libraries.
sourceCodeUrl: 'https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-asset'
packageName: 'expo-asset'
platforms: ['android', 'ios', 'tvos', 'web', 'expo-go']

# Expo Asset

A universal library that allows downloading assets and using them with other libraries.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-asset` provides an interface to Expo's asset system. An asset is any file that lives alongside the source code of your app that the app needs at runtime. Examples include images, fonts, and sounds. Expo's asset system integrates with React Native's, so that you can refer to files with `require('path/to/file')`. This is how you refer to static image files in React Native for use in an `Image` component, for example. Check out React Native's [documentation on static image resources](https://reactnative.dev/docs/images#static-image-resources) for more information. This method of referring to static image resources works out of the box with Expo.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-asset
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-asset` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-asset",
        {
          "assets": ["path/to/file.png", "path/to/directory"]
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assets` | `[]` | An array of asset files or directories to link to the native project. The paths should be relative to the project root so that the file names, whether specified directly or using a directory, will become the resource names. Supported file types:
-   Images: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`
-   Media: `.mp4`, `.mp3`, `.lottie`, `.riv`
-   SQLite database files: `.db`

Note: To import an existing database file (.db), see instructions in SQLite API reference. For other file types (such as .lottie or .riv), see how to add a file extension to assetExts in metro config. |

### Usage

Learn more about how to use the `expo-asset` config plugin to embed an asset file in your project in [Load an asset at build time](/develop/user-interface/assets#load-an-asset-at-build-time).

## API

```js
import { Asset } from 'expo-asset';
```

## Hooks

### `useAssets(moduleIds)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `moduleIds` | `number | number[]` |

  

Downloads and stores one or more assets locally. After the assets are loaded, this hook returns a list of asset instances. If something went wrong when loading the assets, an error is returned.

> Note, the assets are not "reloaded" when you dynamically change the asset list.

Returns: `[Asset[] | undefined, Error | undefined]`

Returns an array containing:

-   on the first position, a list of all loaded assets. If they aren't loaded yet, this value is `undefined`.
-   on the second position, an error which encountered when loading the assets. If there was no error, this value is `undefined`.

Example

```tsx
const [assets, error] = useAssets([require('path/to/asset.jpg'), require('path/to/other.png')]);

return assets ? <Image source={assets[0]} /> : null;
```

## Classes

### `Asset`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

The `Asset` class represents an asset in your app. It gives metadata about the asset (such as its name and type) and provides facilities to load the asset data.

Asset Properties

### `downloaded`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: `boolean` • Default: `false`

Whether the asset has finished downloading from a call to [`downloadAsync()`](#downloadasync).

### `hash`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Read Only • Literal type: `union` • Default: `null`

The MD5 hash of the asset's data.

Acceptable values are: `string` | `null`

### `height`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Literal type: `union` • Default: `null`

If the asset is an image, the height of the image data divided by the scale factor. The scale factor is the number after `@` in the filename, or `1` if not present.

Acceptable values are: `number` | `null`

### `localUri`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Literal type: `union` • Default: `null`

If the asset has been downloaded (by calling [`downloadAsync()`](#downloadasync)), the `file://` URI pointing to the local file on the device that contains the asset data.

Acceptable values are: `string` | `null`

### `name`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: `string`

The name of the asset file without the extension. Also without the part from `@` onward in the filename (used to specify scale factor for images).

### `type`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Read Only • Type: `string`

The extension of the asset filename.

### `uri`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Read Only • Type: `string`

A URI that points to the asset's data on the remote server. When running the published version of your app, this refers to the location on Expo's asset server where Expo has stored your asset. When running the app from Expo CLI during development, this URI points to Expo CLI's server running on your computer and the asset is served directly from your computer. If you are not using Classic Updates (legacy), this field should be ignored as we ensure your assets are on device before running your application logic.

### `width`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Literal type: `union` • Default: `null`

If the asset is an image, the width of the image data divided by the scale factor. The scale factor is the number after `@` in the filename, or `1` if not present.

Acceptable values are: `number` | `null`

Asset Methods

### `downloadAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Downloads the asset data to a local file in the device's cache directory. Once the returned promise is fulfilled without error, the [`localUri`](#localuri) field of this asset points to a local file containing the asset data. The asset is only downloaded if an up-to-date local file for the asset isn't already present due to an earlier download. The downloaded `Asset` will be returned when the promise is resolved.

> **Note:** There is no guarantee that files downloaded via `downloadAsync` persist between app sessions. `downloadAsync` stores files in the caches directory, so it's up to the OS to clear this folder at its own discretion or when the user manually purges the caches directory. Downloaded assets are stored as `ExponentAsset-{cacheFileId}.{extension}` within the cache directory. To manually clear cached assets, you can use [`expo-file-system`](/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem) to delete the cache directory: `Paths.cache.delete()` or use the legacy API `deleteAsync(cacheDirectory)`.

Returns: `Promise<asset>`

Returns a Promise which fulfills with an `Asset` instance.

### `fromMetadata(meta)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `meta` | [AssetMetadata](#assetmetadata) |

  

Returns: `Asset`

### `fromModule(virtualAssetModule)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `virtualAssetModule` | `string | number | { height: number, uri: string, width: number }` | The value of `require('path/to/file')` for the asset or external network URL |

  

Returns the [`Asset`](#asset) instance representing an asset given its module or URL.

Returns: `Asset`

The [`Asset`](#asset) instance for the asset.

### `fromURI(uri)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

# Expo Audio (expo-audio)

A library that provides an API to implement audio playback and recording in apps.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-audio` is a cross-platform audio library for accessing the native audio capabilities of the device.

The [Android media format support documentation](https://developer.android.com/media/media3/exoplayer/supported-formats) covers formats supported when using Expo Player on Android. The [iOS audio and video format documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudiotypes/audio-format-identifiers) lists supported media formats for Apple devices.

Note that audio automatically stops if headphones/Bluetooth audio devices are disconnected.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-audio
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-audio` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-audio",
        {
          "microphonePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone.",
          "enableBackgroundPlayback": true,
          "enableBackgroundRecording": false
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `microphonePermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` permission message. Setting it to `false` will disable the permission. |
| `recordAudioAndroid` | `true` | Only for: Android. A boolean that determines whether to enable the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission on Android. |
| `enableBackgroundRecording` | `false` | A boolean that determines whether to enable background audio recording. On Android, this adds a recording foreground service and permissions and displays a persistent notification during recording. On iOS, this adds the `audio` background mode. **Note:** Background recording can significantly impact battery life. |
| `enableBackgroundPlayback` | `true` | A boolean that determines whether to enable background audio playback. On Android, this adds a media playback foreground service and allows you to display the lockscreen controls and is required for sustained background playback. On iOS, this adds the `audio` background mode. |

## Usage

### Playing sounds

```jsx
import { View, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native';
import { useAudioPlayer } from 'expo-audio';

const audioSource = require('./assets/Hello.mp3');

export default function App() {
  const player = useAudioPlayer(audioSource);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Play Sound" onPress={() => player.play()} />
      <Button
        title="Replay Sound"
        onPress={() => {
          player.seekTo(0);
          player.play();
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',
    padding: 10,
  },
});
```

### Recording sounds

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native';
import {
  useAudioRecorder,
  AudioModule,
  RecordingPresets,
  setAudioModeAsync,
  useAudioRecorderState,
} from 'expo-audio';

export default function App() {
  const audioRecorder = useAudioRecorder(RecordingPresets.HIGH_QUALITY);
  const recorderState = useAudioRecorderState(audioRecorder);

  const record = async () => {
    await audioRecorder.prepareToRecordAsync();
    audioRecorder.record();
  };

  const stopRecording = async () => {
    // The recording will be available on `audioRecorder.uri`.
    await audioRecorder.stop();
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const status = await AudioModule.requestRecordingPermissionsAsync();
      if (!status.granted) {
        Alert.alert('Permission to access microphone was denied');
      }

      setAudioModeAsync({
        playsInSilentMode: true,
        allowsRecording: true,
      });
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button
        title={recorderState.isRecording ? 'Stop Recording' : 'Start Recording'}
        onPress={recorderState.isRecording ? stopRecording : record}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',
    padding: 10,
  },
});
```

### Playing audio in the background

Background audio playback allows your app to continue playing audio when it moves to the background or when the device screen locks.

#### Configuration

To enable background audio playback, use the config plugin in your [app config](/workflow/configuration):

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-audio",
        {
          "enableBackgroundPlayback": true
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

The above configuration automatically configures the required native settings:

-   Android Adds `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` permissions. Also declares a media playback foreground service (`AudioControlsService`) in app's **AndroidManifest.xml**.
-   iOS Adds the `audio` `UIBackgroundMode` capability

#### Usage

After configuring your app with the config plugin, you need to:

1.  **Configure the audio session** to allow background playback
2.  **Enable lock screen controls** (required on Android for sustained background playback)

```jsx
import { View, Button } from 'react-native';
import { useAudioPlayer, setAudioModeAsync } from 'expo-audio';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function AudioPlayerScreen() {
  const audioSource = require('./assets/audio.mp3');
  const player = useAudioPlayer(audioSource);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Configure audio session for background playback
    setAudioModeAsync({
      playsInSilentMode: true,
      shouldPlayInBackground: true,
      interruptionMode: 'doNotMix',
    });
  }, []);

  const handlePlay = () => {
    // Enable lock screen controls with metadata
    player.setActiveForLockScreen(true, {
      title: 'My Audio Title',
      artist: 'Artist Name',
      albumTitle: 'Album Name',
      artworkUrl: 'https://example.com/artwork.jpg', // optional
    });

    // Start playback - this will continue in the background
    player.play();
  };

  const handleStop = () => {
    player.pause();
    // Optionally disable lock screen controls when done
    player.setActiveForLockScreen(false);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Play" onPress={handlePlay} />
      <Button title="Stop" onPress={handleStop} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
Android

> **Note**: On Android, you have to enable the lock screen controls with [`setActiveForLockScreen`](/versions/latest/sdk/audio#setactiveforlockscreenactive-metadata-options) for sustained background playback. Otherwise, the audio will stop after approximately 3 minutes of background playback (OS limitation). Ensure to appropriately [configure the config plugin](/versions/latest/sdk/audio#configuration-in-app-config).

-   A media notification appears in the notification drawer with playback controls
-   Audio continues playing indefinitely in the background
-   Users can control playback from the lock screen and notification
-   The foreground service keeps the playback alive during playback
iOS

On iOS, audio playback continues seamlessly in the background once the audio session is configured with `shouldPlayInBackground: true`. Lock screen controls are optional but enhance the user experience by providing playback controls on the lock screen and Control Center.

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) (you're using native **android** and **ios** projects manually), then you need to configure the following for background playback:

-   For Android, add to **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**:
    
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK" />
    
    <application>
      <!-- Other application components -->
      <service
        android:name="expo.modules.audio.service.AudioControlsService"
        android:exported="false"
        android:foregroundServiceType="mediaPlayback">
        <intent-filter>
          <action android:name="androidx.media3.session.MediaSessionService" />
        </intent-filter>
      </service>
    </application>
    ```
    
-   For iOS, add to **ios/YourApp/Info.plist**:
    
    ```xml
    <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
    <array>
      <string>audio</string>
    </array>
    ```

### Recording audio in the background

> Background recording can significantly impact battery life. Only enable it when necessary for your app's functionality.

Background audio recording allows your app to continue recording when it moves to the background or when the device screen locks.

To enable background recording, use the config plugin in your [app config](/workflow/configuration):

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-audio",
        {
          "microphonePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to record audio.",
          "enableBackgroundRecording": true
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

The above configuration automatically configures the required native settings:

-   Android Adds `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE`, and `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permissions. Also declares an audio recording foreground service in app's **AndroidManifest.xml**.
-   iOS Adds the `audio` `UIBackgroundMode` capability

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) (you're using native **android** and **ios** projects manually), then you need to configure the following permissions in your native projects:

-   For Android, add to **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**:
    
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />
    ```
    
-   For iOS, add to **ios/YourApp/Info.plist**:
    
    ```xml
    <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
    <array>
      <string>audio</string>
    </array>
    ```

#### Usage

After configuring your app, enable background recording at runtime using [`setAudioModeAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/audio#audiosetaudiomodeasyncmode):

```jsx
import { setAudioModeAsync, useAudioRecorder, RecordingPresets } from 'expo-audio';

await setAudioModeAsync({
  playsInSilentMode: true,
  allowsRecording: true,
  allowsBackgroundRecording: true,
});

const recorder = useAudioRecorder(RecordingPresets.HIGH_QUALITY);
await recorder.prepareToRecordAsync();
await recorder.record();

// Recording continues in background
```
Android

On Android, background recording requires a foreground service, which displays a persistent notification with the text "Recording audio" and a stop button. This notification cannot be dismissed while recording is active and automatically disappears when recording stops.
iOS

On iOS, background recording continues seamlessly when the app is in the background or the screen locks. No additional notifications or indicators are shown to the app user beyond the system status bar.

### Using the AudioPlayer directly

In most cases, use the [`useAudioPlayer`](/versions/latest/sdk/audio#useaudioplayersource-options) hook to create an `AudioPlayer` instance. It manages the player's lifecycle and ensures proper disposal when the component unmounts. However, in some advanced use cases, you may need to create an `AudioPlayer` that persists beyond the component's lifecycle. In those cases, use the [`createAudioPlayer`](/versions/latest/sdk/audio#audiocreateaudioplayersource-options) function. You need to be aware of the risks that come with this approach, as it is your responsibility to call the [`release()`](/versions/latest/sdk/expo#release) method when the player is no longer needed. If not handled properly, this approach may lead to memory leaks.

```tsx
import { createAudioPlayer } from 'expo-audio';
const player = createAudioPlayer(audioSource);
```

### Notes on web usage

-   A MediaRecorder issue on Chrome produces WebM files missing the duration metadata. [See the open Chromium issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=642012).
-   MediaRecorder encoding options and other configurations are inconsistent across browsers. Using a polyfill such as [kbumsik/opus-media-recorder](https://github.com/kbumsik/opus-media-recorder) or [ai/audio-recorder-polyfill](https://github.com/ai/audio-recorder-polyfill) in your application will improve your experience. Any options passed to `prepareToRecordAsync` will be passed directly to the MediaRecorder API and as such the polyfill.
-   Web browsers require sites to be served securely for them to listen to a mic. See [MediaDevices `getUserMedia()` security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia#security) for more details.

    <Button title="Play" onPress={() => player.play()} />
  );
}
```

Example

```tsx
import { useAudioPlayer } from 'expo-audio';

function MyComponent() {
  const player = useAudioPlayer('https://example.com/audio.mp3', {
    updateInterval: 1000,
    downloadFirst: true,
  });

  return (
    <Button title="Play" onPress={() => player.play()} />
  );
}
```

### `useAudioPlayerStatus(player)`

import { useAudioPlayer, useAudioSampleListener, requestRecordingPermissionsAsync } from 'expo-audio';

function AudioVisualizerComponent() {
  const player = useAudioPlayer(require('./music.mp3'));

  // if required on Android, request recording permissions
  useEffect(() => {
    async function requestPermission() {
      const { granted } = await requestRecordingPermissionsAsync();
      if (granted) {
        console.log("Permission granted");
      }
    }

    requestPermission();
   }, []);

-   `'mixWithOthers'`: Audio plays alongside other apps without interrupting them. On Android, this means no audio focus is requested. Best suited for sound effects, UI feedback, or short audio clips.

. Default: `'mixWithOthers'` |
| interruptionModeAndroid(optional) | [InterruptionModeAndroid](#interruptionmodeandroid) | Deprecated: Use interruptionMode instead, which now works on both platforms. . Supported platforms: Android. Determines how the audio session interacts with other sessions on Android. |
| playsInSilentMode | `boolean` | Supported platforms: iOS. Determines if audio playback is allowed when the device is in silent mode. |
| shouldPlayInBackground(optional) | `boolean` | Whether the audio session stays active when the app moves to the background. Note: On Android, you have to enable the lockscreen controls with setActiveForLockScreen for sustained background playback. Otherwise, the audio will stop after approximately 3 minutes of background playback (OS limitation). Make sure to also appropriately configure the config-plugin. Default: `false` |
| shouldRouteThroughEarpiece(optional) | `boolean` | Whether the audio should route through the earpiece. On iOS, this only has an effect when `allowsRecording` is `true` (i.e., the audio session category is `.playAndRecord`). When `false` (the default), audio is routed through the speaker. Default: `false` |

### `AudioPlayerOptions`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Options for configuring audio player behavior.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| crossOrigin(optional) | `'anonymous' | 'use-credentials'` | Supported platforms: Web. Determines the [cross origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/crossorigin) used by the underlying native view on web. If `undefined` (default), does not use CORS at all. If set to `'anonymous'`, the audio will be loaded with CORS enabled. Note that some audio may not play if CORS is enabled, depending on the CDN settings. If you encounter issues, consider adjusting the `crossOrigin` property. Default: `undefined` |
| downloadFirst(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web. If set to `true`, the system will attempt to download the resource to the device before loading. This value defaults to `false`. Works with:
-   Local assets from `require('path/to/file')`
-   Remote HTTP/HTTPS URLs
-   Asset objects

. When enabled, this ensures the audio file is fully downloaded before playback begins. This can improve playback performance and reduce buffering, especially for users managing multiple audio players simultaneously. On Android and iOS, this will download the audio file to the device's tmp directory before playback begins. The system will purge the file at its discretion. On web, this will download the audio file to the user's device memory and make it available for the user to play. The system will usually purge the file from memory after a reload or on memory pressure. On web, CORS restrictions apply to the blob url, so you need to make sure the server returns the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. |
| keepAudioSessionActive(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: iOS. If set to `true`, the audio session will not be deactivated when this player pauses or finishes playback. This prevents interrupting other audio sources (like videos) when the audio ends. Useful for sound effects that should not interfere with ongoing video playback or other audio. The audio session for this player will not be deactivated automatically when the player finishes playback. Note: If needed, you can manually deactivate the audio session using setIsAudioActiveAsync(false). Default: `false` |
| preferredForwardBufferDuration(optional) | `number` | Supported platforms: Android, iOS. The duration in seconds the player should buffer ahead of the current playback position. A higher value improves playback stability at the cost of more memory/network usage.

-   **iOS**: Maps to `AVPlayerItem.preferredForwardBufferDuration`. A value of `0` lets the system decide.
-   **Android**: Configures ExoPlayer's `DefaultLoadControl` max buffer duration.
-   **Web**: Not applicable (browser manages buffering).

. Default: `0 (system default)` |
| updateInterval(optional) | `number` | Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web. How often (in milliseconds) to emit playback status updates. Defaults to 500ms. Default: `500ms`. Example

```tsx
import { useAudioPlayer } from 'expo-audio';

export default function App() {
  const player = useAudioPlayer(source);

  // High-frequency updates for smooth progress bars
  const player = useAudioPlayer(source, { updateInterval: 100 });

  // Standard updates (default behavior)
  const player = useAudioPlayer(source, { updateInterval: 500 });

  // Low-frequency updates for better performance
  const player = useAudioPlayer(source, { updateInterval: 1000 });
}
```

# Expo AuthSession

A universal library that provides an API to handle browser-based authentication.
Android, iOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`AuthSession` enables web browser-based authentication (for example, browser-based OAuth flows) in your app by utilizing [WebBrowser](/versions/latest/sdk/webbrowser) and [Crypto](/versions/latest/sdk/crypto). For implementation details, refer to this reference, and for usage, see the [Authentication](/guides/authentication) guide.

> **Note:** `AuthSession` enables general-purpose OAuth and OpenID Connect browser-based auth workflows. Where available, we recommend using a library supplied by your identity provider, as it will handle implementation details specific to that provider. For example, use [`@react-native-google-signin/google-signin`](/guides/google-authentication) for Google authentication and [`react-native-fbsdk-next`](/guides/facebook-authentication) for Facebook. For more information, see [Authentication](/develop/authentication) overview.

## Installation

> `expo-crypto` is a peer dependency and must be installed alongside `expo-auth-session`.

```sh
npx expo install expo-auth-session expo-crypto
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

To use this library, you need to set up deep linking in your app by setting up a `scheme`. Use the [`uri-scheme` CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uri-scheme) utility to easily add, remove, list, and open your URIs.

For example, to make your native app handle `mycoolredirect://`, run:

```sh
npx uri-scheme add mycoolredirect
```

You should now be able to see a list of all your project's schemes by running:

```sh
npx uri-scheme list
```

You can test it to ensure it works like this:

```sh
yarn android
yarn ios
npx uri-scheme open mycoolredirect://some/redirect
```

### Usage in standalone apps

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "scheme": "mycoolredirect"
  }
}
```

To be able to deep link back into your app, you will need to set a `scheme` in your project's app config, and then build your standalone app (it can't be updated with an update). If you do not include a scheme, the authentication flow will complete, but it will be unable to pass the information back into your application and the user will have to manually exit the authentication modal (resulting in a canceled event).

## Guides

> The guides have moved: [Authentication Guide](/guides/authentication).

## How web browser based authentication flows work

The typical flow for browser-based authentication in mobile apps is as follows:

-   **Initiation**: the user presses a sign in button
-   **Open web browser**: the app opens up a web browser to the authentication provider sign in page. The url that is opened for the sign in page usually includes information to identify the app, and a URL to redirect to on success. _Note: the web browser should share cookies with your system web browser so that users do not need to sign in again if they are already authenticated on the system browser -- Expo's [WebBrowser](/versions/latest/sdk/webbrowser) API takes care of this._
-   **Authentication provider redirects**: upon successful authentication, the authentication provider should redirect back to the application by redirecting to URL provided by the app in the query parameters on the sign in page ([read more about how linking works in mobile apps](/linking/overview)), _provided that the URL is in the allowlist of allowed redirect URLs_. Allowlisting redirect URLs is important to prevent malicious actors from pretending to be your application. The redirect includes data in the URL (such as user id and token), either in the location hash, query parameters, or both.
-   **App handles redirect**: the redirect is handled by the app and data is parsed from the redirect URL.

## Security considerations

-   **Never put any secret keys inside your application code, there is no secure way to do this!** Instead, you should store your secret key(s) on a server and expose an endpoint that makes API calls for your client and passes the data back.

## API

```js
import * as AuthSession from 'expo-auth-session';
```

## Hooks

### `useAuthRequest(config, discovery)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config` | [AuthRequestConfig](#authrequestconfig) | A valid [`AuthRequestConfig`](#authrequestconfig) that specifies what provider to use. |
| `discovery` | [DiscoveryDocument](#discoverydocument) | null | A loaded [`DiscoveryDocument`](#discoverydocument) with endpoints used for authenticating. Only `authorizationEndpoint` is required for requesting an authorization code. |

  

Load an authorization request for a code. When the prompt method completes then the response will be fulfilled.

> In order to close the popup window on web, you need to invoke `WebBrowser.maybeCompleteAuthSession()`. See the [GitHub example](/guides/authentication#github) for more info.

If an Implicit grant flow was used, you can pass the `response.params` to `TokenResponse.fromQueryParams()` to get a `TokenResponse` instance which you can use to easily refresh the token.

Returns: `[AuthRequest | null, AuthSessionResult | null, (options: AuthRequestPromptOptions) => Promise<authsessionresult>]</authsessionresult>`

Returns a loaded request, a response, and a prompt method in a single array in the following order:

-   `request` - An instance of [`AuthRequest`](#authrequest) that can be used to prompt the user for authorization. This will be `null` until the auth request has finished loading.
-   `response` - This is `null` until `promptAsync` has been invoked. Once fulfilled it will return information about the authorization.
-   `promptAsync` - When invoked, a web browser will open up and prompt the user for authentication. Accepts an [`AuthRequestPromptOptions`](#authrequestpromptoptions) object with options about how the prompt will execute.

Example

```ts
const [request, response, promptAsync] = useAuthRequest({ ... }, { ... });
```

### `useAuthRequestResult(request, discovery, customOptions)`

## Advanced usage

### Filtering out AuthSession events in Linking handlers

There are many reasons why you might want to handle inbound links into your app, such as push notifications or just regular deep linking (you can read more about this in the [Linking](/linking/overview)); authentication redirects are only one type of deep link, and `AuthSession` handles these particular links for you. In your own `Linking.addEventListener` handlers, you can filter out deep links that are handled by `AuthSession` by checking if the URL includes the `+expo-auth-session` string -- if it does, you can ignore it. This works because `AuthSession` adds `+expo-auth-session` to the default `returnUrl`; however, if you provide your own `returnUrl`, you may want to consider adding a similar identifier to enable you to filter out `AuthSession` events from other handlers.

### With React Navigation

If you are using deep linking with React Navigation, filtering through `Linking.addEventListener` will not be sufficient because deep linking is [handled differently](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/configuring-links/#advanced-cases). Instead, to filter these events, add a custom `getStateFromPath` function to your linking configuration, and then filter by URL in the same way as described above.

# Expo BackgroundFetch

A library that provides API for performing background fetch tasks.
Android, iOS

> **Deprecated:** The `expo-background-fetch` library is being replaced by a new version in [`expo-background-task`](/versions/latest/sdk/background-task). `expo-background-fetch` is not receiving patches and will be removed in an upcoming release.

`expo-background-fetch` provides an API to perform [background fetch](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/managing_your_app_s_life_cycle/preparing_your_app_to_run_in_the_background/updating_your_app_with_background_app_refresh) tasks, allowing you to run specific code periodically in the background to update your app. This module uses [TaskManager](/versions/latest/sdk/task-manager) Native API under the hood.

#### Known issues 

`BackgroundFetch` only works when the app is backgrounded, not if the app was terminated or upon device reboot. You can check out [the relevant GitHub issue](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/3582) for more details.

On iOS the `BackgroundFetch` library requires you to use a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction) since Background Fetch is not enabled in the iOS Expo Go app.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-background-fetch
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration 

To be able to run background fetch tasks on iOS, you need to add the `fetch` value to the `UIBackgroundModes` array in your app's **Info.plist** file. This is required for background fetch to work properly.

**If you're using [CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)**, the required `UIBackgroundModes` configuration will be applied automatically by prebuild.

Configure UIBackgroundModes manually on iOS

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using a native **ios** project manually, then you'll need to add the following to your **Expo.plist** file:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

## Usage

Below is an example that demonstrates how to use `expo-background-fetch`.

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button } from 'react-native';
import * as BackgroundFetch from 'expo-background-fetch';
import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';

const BACKGROUND_FETCH_TASK = 'background-fetch';

// 1. Define the task by providing a name and the function that should be executed
// Note: This needs to be called in the global scope (e.g outside of your React components)
TaskManager.defineTask(BACKGROUND_FETCH_TASK, async () => {
  const now = Date.now();

  console.log(`Got background fetch call at date: ${new Date(now).toISOString()}`);

  // Be sure to return the successful result type!
  return BackgroundFetch.BackgroundFetchResult.NewData;
});

// 2. Register the task at some point in your app by providing the same name,
// and some configuration options for how the background fetch should behave
// Note: This does NOT need to be in the global scope and CAN be used in your React components!
async function registerBackgroundFetchAsync() {
  return BackgroundFetch.registerTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_FETCH_TASK, {
    minimumInterval: 60 * 15, // 15 minutes
    stopOnTerminate: false, // android only,
    startOnBoot: true, // android only
  });
}

// 3. (Optional) Unregister tasks by specifying the task name
// This will cancel any future background fetch calls that match the given name
// Note: This does NOT need to be in the global scope and CAN be used in your React components!
async function unregisterBackgroundFetchAsync() {
  return BackgroundFetch.unregisterTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_FETCH_TASK);
}

export default function BackgroundFetchScreen() {
  const [isRegistered, setIsRegistered] = useState(false);
  const [status, setStatus] = useState<BackgroundFetch.BackgroundFetchStatus | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    checkStatusAsync();
  }, []);

  const checkStatusAsync = async () => {
    const status = await BackgroundFetch.getStatusAsync();
    const isRegistered = await TaskManager.isTaskRegisteredAsync(BACKGROUND_FETCH_TASK);
    setStatus(status);
    setIsRegistered(isRegistered);
  };

  const toggleFetchTask = async () => {
    if (isRegistered) {
      await unregisterBackgroundFetchAsync();
    } else {
      await registerBackgroundFetchAsync();
    }

    checkStatusAsync();
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.screen}>
      <View style={styles.textContainer}>
        <Text>
          Background fetch status:{' '}
          <Text style={styles.boldText}>
            {status && BackgroundFetch.BackgroundFetchStatus[status]}
          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Background fetch task name:{' '}
          <Text style={styles.boldText}>
            {isRegistered ? BACKGROUND_FETCH_TASK : 'Not registered yet!'}
          </Text>
        </Text>
      </View>
      <View style={styles.textContainer}></View>
      <Button
        title={isRegistered ? 'Unregister BackgroundFetch task' : 'Register BackgroundFetch task'}
        onPress={toggleFetchTask}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  screen: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  textContainer: {
    margin: 10,
  },
  boldText: {
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```

## Triggering background fetches

Background fetches can be difficult to test because they can happen inconsistently. Fortunately, you can trigger background fetches manually when developing your apps.

For iOS, you can use the `Instruments` app on macOS to manually trigger background fetches:

1.  Open the Instruments app. The Instruments app can be searched through Spotlight (⌘ + Space) or opened from `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Instruments.app`
2.  Select `Time Profiler`
3.  Select your device / simulator and pick the `Expo Go` app
4.  Press the `Record` button in the top left corner
5.  Navigate to the `Document` Menu and select `Simulate Background Fetch - Expo Go`:

For Android, you can set the `minimumInterval` option of your task to a small number and background your application like so:

```tsx
async function registerBackgroundFetchAsync() {
  return BackgroundFetch.registerTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_FETCH_TASK, {
    minimumInterval: 1 * 60, // task will fire 1 minute after app is backgrounded
  });
}
```

## API

```js
import * as BackgroundFetch from 'expo-background-fetch';
```

## Methods

> **Deprecated:** Use [`getStatusAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/background-task#backgroundtaskgetstatusasync) from `expo-background-task` instead. The `expo-background-fetch` package has been deprecated.

### `BackgroundFetch.getStatusAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Gets a status of background fetch.

Returns: `Promise<backgroundfetchstatus>`

Returns a promise which fulfils with one of `BackgroundFetchStatus` enum values.

> **Deprecated:** Use [`registerTaskAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/background-task#backgroundtaskregistertaskasynctaskname-options) from `expo-background-task` instead. The `expo-background-fetch` package has been deprecated.

### `BackgroundFetch.registerTaskAsync(taskName, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `taskName` | `string` | Name of the task to register. The task needs to be defined first - see [`TaskManager.defineTask`](/versions/latest/sdk/task-manager#taskmanagerdefinetaskttaskname-taskexecutor) for more details. |
| `options`(optional) | [BackgroundFetchOptions](#backgroundfetchoptions) | An object containing the background fetch options. Default: `{}` |

  

Registers background fetch task with given name. Registered tasks are saved in persistent storage and restored once the app is initialized.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

Example

```ts
import * as BackgroundFetch from 'expo-background-fetch';
import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';

TaskManager.defineTask(YOUR_TASK_NAME, () => {
  try {
    const receivedNewData = // do your background fetch here
    return receivedNewData ? BackgroundFetch.BackgroundFetchResult.NewData : BackgroundFetch.BackgroundFetchResult.NoData;
  } catch (error) {
    return BackgroundFetch.BackgroundFetchResult.Failed;
  }
});
```

> **Deprecated:** Use the [`registerTaskAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/background-task#backgroundtaskregistertaskasynctaskname-options) method from expo-background-task package, and specify [`BackgroundTaskOptions`](/versions/latest/sdk/background-task#backgroundtaskoptions) argument instead, when setting task interval time.

### `BackgroundFetch.setMinimumIntervalAsync(minimumInterval)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `minimumInterval` | `number` | Number of seconds that must elapse before another background fetch can be called. |

  

Sets the minimum number of seconds that must elapse before another background fetch can be initiated. This value is advisory only and does not indicate the exact amount of time expected between fetch operations.

> This method doesn't take any effect on Android. It is a global value which means that it can overwrite settings from another application opened through Expo Go.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A promise which fulfils once the minimum interval is set.

> **Deprecated:** Use [`unregisterTaskAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/background-task#backgroundtaskunregistertaskasynctaskname) from `expo-background-task` instead. The `expo-background-fetch` package has been deprecated.

### `BackgroundFetch.unregisterTaskAsync(taskName)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `taskName` | `string` | Name of the task to unregister. |

  

Unregisters background fetch task, so the application will no longer be executing this task.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A promise which fulfils when the task is fully unregistered.

## Interfaces

### `BackgroundFetchOptions`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| minimumInterval(optional) | `number` | Inexact interval in seconds between subsequent repeats of the background fetch alarm. The final interval may differ from the specified one to minimize wakeups and battery usage.
-   On Android it defaults to **10 minutes**,
-   On iOS it calls [`BackgroundFetch.setMinimumIntervalAsync`](#backgroundfetchsetminimumintervalasyncminimuminterval) behind the scenes and the default value is the smallest fetch interval supported by the system **(10-15 minutes)**. Background fetch task receives no data, but your task should return a value that best describes the results of your background fetch work.

 |
| startOnBoot(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: Android. Whether to restart background fetch events when the device has finished booting. Default: `false` |
| stopOnTerminate(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: Android. Whether to stop receiving background fetch events after user terminates the app. Default: `true` |

## Enums

### `BackgroundFetchResult`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

This return value is to let iOS know what the result of your background fetch was, so the platform can better schedule future background fetches. Also, your app has up to 30 seconds to perform the task, otherwise your app will be terminated and future background fetches may be delayed.

#### `NoData`

`BackgroundFetchResult.NoData = 1`

There was no new data to download.

#### `NewData`

`BackgroundFetchResult.NewData = 2`

New data was successfully downloaded.

#### `Failed`

`BackgroundFetchResult.Failed = 3`

An attempt to download data was made but that attempt failed.

### `BackgroundFetchStatus`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

#### `Denied`

`BackgroundFetchStatus.Denied = 1`

The user explicitly disabled background behavior for this app or for the whole system.

#### `Restricted`

`BackgroundFetchStatus.Restricted = 2`

Background updates are unavailable and the user cannot enable them again. This status can occur when, for example, parental controls are in effect for the current user.

#### `Available`

`BackgroundFetchStatus.Available = 3`

Background updates are available for the app.

## Permissions

### Android

On Android, this module might listen when the device is starting up. It's necessary to continue working on tasks started with `startOnBoot`. It also keeps devices "awake" that are going idle and asleep fast, to improve reliability of the tasks. Because of this both the `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` and `WAKE_LOCK` permissions are added automatically.

| Android Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. |
| `WAKE_LOCK` | Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming. |

# Expo BackgroundTask

A library that provides an API for running background tasks.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Included in Expo Go

`expo-background-task` provides an API to run deferrable background tasks in a way that optimizes battery and power consumption on the end user's device. This module uses the [`WorkManager`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) API on Android and the [`BGTaskScheduler`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks/bgtaskscheduler) API on iOS to schedule tasks. It also uses the [`expo-task-manager`](/versions/latest/sdk/task-manager) Native API to run JavaScript tasks.

[Watch: Expo Background Task Deep Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lFus7TvayI)

## Background tasks

A background task is a deferrable unit of work that is performed in the background, outside your app's lifecycle. This is useful for tasks that need to be executed when the app is inactive, such as syncing data with a server, fetching new content, or even checking if there are any [`expo-updates`](/versions/latest/sdk/updates).

### When are background tasks run?

The Expo Background Task API leverages each platform to execute tasks at the most optimal time for both the user and the device when the app is in the background.

This means that the task may not run immediately after it is scheduled, but it will run at some point in the future if the system decides so. You can specify a minimum interval in minutes for the task to run. The task will execute sometime after the interval has passed, provided the specified conditions are met.

A background task will only run if the battery has enough charge (or the device is plugged into power) and the network is available. Without these conditions, the task won't execute. The exact behavior will vary depending on the operating system.

### When will they be stopped?

Background tasks are managed by platform APIs and system constraints. Knowing when tasks stop helps plan their use effectively.

-   Background tasks are stopped if the user kills the app. Tasks resume when the app is restarted.
-   If the system stops the app or the device reboots, background tasks will resume, and the app will be restarted.

On Android, removing an app from the recent apps list doesn't completely stop it, whereas on iOS, swiping it away in the app switcher fully terminates it.

> On Android, behavior varies by device vendor. For example, some implementations treat removing an app from the recent apps list as killing it. Read more about these differences here: [https://dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com).

## Platform differences

### Android 

On Android, the [`WorkManager`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) API allows specifying a minimum interval for a task to run (minimum 15 minutes). The task will execute sometime after the interval has passed, provided the specified conditions are met.

### iOS 

On iOS, the [`BGTaskScheduler`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks/bgtaskscheduler) API decides the best time to launch your background task. The system will consider the battery level, the network availability, and the user's usage patterns to determine when to run the task. You can still specify a minimum interval for the task to run, but the system may choose to run the task at a later time.

## Known limitations

### iOS 

The [`Background Tasks`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks) API is unavailable on iOS simulators. It is only available when running on a physical device.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-background-task
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config 

To be able to run background tasks on iOS, you need to add the following to your app's **Info.plist** file:

-   The `processing` value to the `UIBackgroundModes` array. This enables the background processing capability.
-   The `BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers` array with the `com.expo.modules.backgroundtask.processing` identifier. This registers the permitted background task identifier.

**If you're using [CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)**, both the required `UIBackgroundModes` and `BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers` configurations will be applied automatically by prebuild.

Configure Info.plist manually on iOS

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)), then you'll need to add the following to your **Info.plist** file:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>processing</string>
</array>
<key>BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers</key>
<array>
  <string>com.expo.modules.backgroundtask.processing</string>
</array>
```

## Usage

Below is an example that demonstrates how to use `expo-background-task`.

```tsx
import * as BackgroundTask from 'expo-background-task';
import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button } from 'react-native';

const BACKGROUND_TASK_IDENTIFIER = 'background-task';

// Register and create the task so that it is available also when the background task screen
// (a React component defined later in this example) is not visible.
// Note: This needs to be called in the global scope, not in a React component.
TaskManager.defineTask(BACKGROUND_TASK_IDENTIFIER, async () => {
  try {
    const now = Date.now();
    console.log(`Got background task call at date: ${new Date(now).toISOString()}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to execute the background task:', error);
    return BackgroundTask.BackgroundTaskResult.Failed;
  }
  return BackgroundTask.BackgroundTaskResult.Success;
});

// 2. Register the task at some point in your app by providing the same name
// Note: This does NOT need to be in the global scope and CAN be used in your React components!
async function registerBackgroundTaskAsync() {
  return BackgroundTask.registerTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_TASK_IDENTIFIER);
}

// 3. (Optional) Unregister tasks by specifying the task name
// This will cancel any future background task calls that match the given name
// Note: This does NOT need to be in the global scope and CAN be used in your React components!
async function unregisterBackgroundTaskAsync() {
  return BackgroundTask.unregisterTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_TASK_IDENTIFIER);
}

export default function BackgroundTaskScreen() {
  const [isRegistered, setIsRegistered] = useState<boolean>(false);
  const [status, setStatus] = useState<BackgroundTask.BackgroundTaskStatus | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    updateAsync();
  }, []);

  const updateAsync = async () => {
    const status = await BackgroundTask.getStatusAsync();
    setStatus(status);
    const isRegistered = await TaskManager.isTaskRegisteredAsync(BACKGROUND_TASK_IDENTIFIER);
    setIsRegistered(isRegistered);
  };

  const toggle = async () => {
    if (!isRegistered) {
      await registerBackgroundTaskAsync();
    } else {
      await unregisterBackgroundTaskAsync();
    }
    await updateAsync();
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.screen}>
      <View style={styles.textContainer}>
        <Text>
          Background Task Service Availability:{' '}
          <Text style={styles.boldText}>
            {status ? BackgroundTask.BackgroundTaskStatus[status] : null}
          </Text>
        </Text>
      </View>
      <Button
        disabled={status === BackgroundTask.BackgroundTaskStatus.Restricted}
        title={isRegistered ? 'Cancel Background Task' : 'Schedule Background Task'}
        onPress={toggle}
      />
      <Button title="Check Background Task Status" onPress={updateAsync} />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  screen: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  textContainer: {
    margin: 10,
  },
  boldText: {
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```

## Multiple background tasks

Since the Background Tasks API on iOS and the WorkManager API on Android limit the number of tasks that can be scheduled for a single app, Expo Background Task uses a single worker on both platforms. While you can define multiple JavaScript background tasks, they will all run through this single worker.

The last registered background task determines the minimum interval for execution.

## Testing background tasks

Background tasks can be tested using the [`triggerTaskWorkerForTestingAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/background-task#backgroundtasktriggertaskworkerfortestingasync) method. This method will run all registered tasks directly on Android and invoke the `BGTaskScheduler` on iOS. This is useful for testing the behavior of your background tasks without having to wait for the system to trigger them.

This method is only available in development mode. It will not work in production builds.

```tsx
import * as BackgroundTask from 'expo-background-task';
import { Button } from 'react-native';

function App() {
  const triggerTask = async () => {
    await BackgroundTask.triggerTaskWorkerForTestingAsync();
  };

  return <Button title="Trigger Background Task" onPress={triggerTask} />;
}
```

## Inspecting background tasks 

To troubleshoot or debug issues with background tasks on Android, use the `adb` tool included with the Android SDK to inspect scheduled tasks:

```sh
adb shell dumpsys jobscheduler | grep -A 40 -m 1 -E "JOB #.* "
```

The output from this command will show you the scheduled tasks for your app, including their status, constraints, and other information. Look for the `JOB` line to find the ID of the job and other details in the output:

```text
JOB #u0a453/275: 216a359 <package-name>/androidx.work.impl.background.systemjob.SystemJobService
  u0a453 tag=*job*/<package-name>/androidx.work.impl.background.systemjob.SystemJobService#275
  Source: uid=u0a453 user=0 pkg=<package-name>
  ...
  Required constraints: TIMING_DELAY CONNECTIVITY UID_NOT_RESTRICTED [0x90100000]
  Preferred constraints:
  Dynamic constraints:
  Satisfied constraints: CONNECTIVITY DEVICE_NOT_DOZING BACKGROUND_NOT_RESTRICTED TARE_WEALTH WITHIN_QUOTA UID_NOT_RESTRICTED [0x1b500000]
  Unsatisfied constraints: TIMING_DELAY [0x80000000]
  ...
  Enqueue time: -8m12s280ms
  Run time: earliest=+6m47s715ms, latest=none, original latest=none
  Restricted due to: none.
  Ready: false (job=false user=true !restricted=true !pending=true !active=true !backingup=true comp=true)
```

The first line contains the Job ID (275). The `Run time: earliest` value indicates the earliest time the task may start, while `enqueue time` shows how long ago the task was scheduled.

To force a task to run, use the `adb shell am broadcast` command. Move your app to the background before running this command, as the task will not run if the app is in the foreground.

```sh
adb shell cmd jobscheduler run -f
```

Where `JOB_ID` would be the identifier of the job you want to run that you found in the previous step.

## Troubleshooting background tasks 

iOS does not have a tool similar to `adb` for inspecting background tasks. To test background tasks on iOS, use the built-in [`triggerTaskWorkerForTestingAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/background-task#backgroundtasktriggertaskworkerfortestingasync) method. This method simulates the system triggering the task.

You can trigger this method from your app in debug mode (it does not work in production builds) to test the behavior of your background tasks without waiting for the system. If your background task configuration is incorrect, you will see the error description in the Xcode console:

```text
No task request with identifier com.expo.modules.backgroundtask.processing has been scheduled
```

The above error tells you that you need to run prebuild to apply the changes to your app's configuration.

This error also means you must run prebuild to apply your background task configuration to the app. Additionally, ensure you have defined and registered a background task as shown in [this example](/versions/latest/sdk/background-task#usage).

## API

```js
import * as BackgroundTask from 'expo-background-task';
```

## Methods

### `BackgroundTask.getStatusAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Returns the status for the Background Task API. On web, it always returns `BackgroundTaskStatus.Restricted`, while on native platforms it returns `BackgroundTaskStatus.Available`.

Returns: `Promise<backgroundtaskstatus>`

A BackgroundTaskStatus enum value or `null` if not available.

### `BackgroundTask.registerTaskAsync(taskName, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `taskName` | `string` | Name of the task to register. The task needs to be defined first - see [`TaskManager.defineTask`](/versions/latest/sdk/task-manager#taskmanagerdefinetasktaskname-taskexecutor) for more details. |
| `options`(optional) | [BackgroundTaskOptions](#backgroundtaskoptions) | An object containing the background task options. Default: `{}` |

  

Registers a background task with the given name. Registered tasks are saved in persistent storage and restored once the app is initialized.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

Example

```ts
import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';

// Register the task outside of the component
TaskManager.defineTask(BACKGROUND_TASK_IDENTIFIER, () => {
  try {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem(LAST_TASK_DATE_KEY, Date.now().toString());
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to save the last fetch date', error);
    return BackgroundTaskResult.Failed;
  }
  return BackgroundTaskResult.Success;
});
```

You can now use the `registerTaskAsync` function to register the task:

```ts
BackgroundTask.registerTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_TASK_IDENTIFIER, {});
```

### `BackgroundTask.triggerTaskWorkerForTestingAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

When in debug mode this function will trigger running the background tasks. This function will only work for apps built in debug mode. This method is only available in development mode. It will not work in production builds.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

A promise which fulfils when the task is triggered.

### `BackgroundTask.unregisterTaskAsync(taskName)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `taskName` | `string` | Name of the task to unregister. |

  

Unregisters a background task, so the application will no longer be executing this task.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A promise which fulfils when the task is fully unregistered.

## Event Subscriptions

### `BackgroundTask.addExpirationListener(listener)`

Supported platforms: iOS.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `listener` | `() => void` |

  

Adds a listener that is called when the background executor expires. On iOS, tasks can run for minutes, but the system can interrupt the process at any time. This listener is called when the system decides to stop the background tasks and should be used to clean up resources or save state. When the expiry handler is called, the main task runner is rescheduled automatically.

Returns: `{ remove: () => void }`

An object with a `remove` method to unsubscribe the listener.

## Types

### `BackgroundTaskOptions`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Options for registering a background task

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| minimumInterval(optional) | `number` | Inexact interval in minutes between subsequent repeats of the background tasks. The final interval may differ from the specified one to minimize wakeups and battery usage.
-   Defaults to once every 12 hours (The minimum interval is 15 minutes)
-   The system controls the background task execution interval and treats the specified value as a minimum delay. Tasks won't run exactly on schedule. On iOS, short intervals are often ignored—the system typically runs background tasks during specific windows, such as overnight.

 |

## Enums

### `BackgroundTaskResult`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Return value for background tasks.

#### `Success`

`BackgroundTaskResult.Success = 1`

The task finished successfully.

#### `Failed`

`BackgroundTaskResult.Failed = 2`

The task failed.

### `BackgroundTaskStatus`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Availability status for background tasks

#### `Restricted`

`BackgroundTaskStatus.Restricted = 1`

Background tasks are unavailable.

#### `Available`

`BackgroundTaskStatus.Available = 2`

Background tasks are available for the app.

# Expo Blob

A web standards-compliant Blob implementation for React Native.
Android, iOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-blob` provides a web standards-compliant Blob implementation for React Native that offers superior performance and works consistently across all platforms. It is more reliable compared to the implementation exported from `react-native`, unlike Blob from `react-native`, which has limitations with the `slice()` method and other Web API features.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-blob
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Basic blob creation

```typescript
import { Blob } from 'expo-blob';

// Create an empty blob
const emptyBlob = new Blob();

// Create a blob from text
const textBlob = new Blob(['Hello, World!'], { type: 'text/plain' });

// Create a blob from binary data
const binaryBlob = new Blob([new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4])], {
  type: 'application/octet-stream',
});

// Create a blob from mixed content
const mixedBlob = new Blob(
  [
    'Text content',
    new Uint8Array([65, 66, 67]), // ABC in ASCII
    'More text',
  ],
  { type: 'text/plain' }
);
```

### Blob properties

```typescript
const blob = new Blob(['Hello, World!'], { type: 'text/plain' });

console.log(blob.size); // 13 (bytes)
console.log(blob.type); // "text/plain"
```

### Reading blob content

```typescript
const blob = new Blob(['Hello, World!'], { type: 'text/plain' });

// Read as text
const text = await blob.text();
console.log(text); // "Hello, World!"

// Read as bytes
const bytes = await blob.bytes();
console.log(bytes); // Uint8Array(13) [72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33]

// Read as ArrayBuffer
const arrayBuffer = await blob.arrayBuffer();
console.log(arrayBuffer); // ArrayBuffer(13)
```

### Slicing blobs

```typescript
const blob = new Blob(['Hello, World!'], { type: 'text/plain' });

// Slice from position 0 to 5
const slice1 = blob.slice(0, 5);
console.log(await slice1.text()); // "Hello"

// Slice from position 7 to end
const slice2 = blob.slice(7);
console.log(await slice2.text()); // "World!"

// Slice with custom type
const slice3 = blob.slice(0, 5, 'text/html');
console.log(slice3.type); // "text/html"
```

### Streaming

```typescript
const blob = new Blob(['Large content...'], { type: 'text/plain' });

// Create a readable stream
const stream = blob.stream();
const reader = stream.getReader();

// Read chunks
while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;
  console.log('Chunk:', value);
}

# Expo BlurView

A React component that blurs everything underneath the view.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

A React component that blurs everything underneath the view. Common usage of this is for navigation bars, tab bars, and modals.

> In SDK 55 and later, `expo-blur` is stable on Android, but some code changes are required for the `BlurView` to work. See the [Android support](/versions/latest/sdk/blur-view#android-support) section to learn more.

#### Known issues

The blur effect does not update when `BlurView` is rendered before dynamic content is rendered using, for example, `FlatList`. To fix this, make sure that `BlurView` is rendered after the dynamic content component. For example:

```jsx
<View>
  <FlatList />
  <BlurView />
</View>
```

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-blur
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

Basic iOS and web-only `BlurView` usage

This is the legacy way of creating a `BlurView`, which will result in a blur only on iOS. On Android, this will result in a view with a semi-transparent background.

```jsx
import { Text, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';
import { BlurView } from 'expo-blur';

export default function App() {
  const text = 'Hello, my container is blurring contents underneath!';
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.background}>
        {[...Array(20).keys()].map(i => (
          <View
            key={`box-${i}`}
            style={[styles.box, i % 2 === 1 ? styles.boxOdd : styles.boxEven]}
          />
        ))}
      </View>
      <BlurView intensity={100} style={styles.blurContainer}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>{text}</Text>
      </BlurView>
      <BlurView intensity={80} tint="light" style={styles.blurContainer}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>{text}</Text>
      </BlurView>
      <BlurView intensity={90} tint="dark" style={styles.blurContainer}>
        <Text style={[styles.text, { color: '#fff' }]}>{text}</Text>
      </BlurView>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  blurContainer: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 20,
    margin: 16,
    textAlign: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    overflow: 'hidden',
    borderRadius: 20,
  },
  background: {
    flex: 1,
    flexWrap: 'wrap',
    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFill,
  },
  box: {
    width: '25%',
    height: '20%',
  },
  boxEven: {
    backgroundColor: 'orangered',
  },
  boxOdd: {
    backgroundColor: 'gold',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: '600',
  },
});
```
Basic `BlurView` usage with Android support

To blur the background of a view on Android, wrap the content to be blurred in a `BlurTargetView` component and pass its ref to the `BlurView`.

> **Note:** Notice that, as long as all of the `BlurViews` fit into the bounds of a single `BlurTargetView`, you can use the single `BlurTargetView` for multiple `BlurViews`. This is more efficient than creating multiple `BlurTargetViews`.

```tsx
import { BlurView, BlurTargetView } from 'expo-blur';
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { Text, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  const targetRef = useRef<View | null>(null);
  const text = 'Hello, my container is blurring contents underneath!';

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <BlurTargetView ref={targetRef} style={styles.background}>
        {[...Array(20).keys()].map(i => (
          <View
            key={`box-${i}`}
            style={[styles.box, i % 2 === 1 ? styles.boxOdd : styles.boxEven]}
          />
        ))}
      </BlurTargetView>
      <BlurView
        blurTarget={targetRef}
        intensity={100}
        style={styles.blurContainer}
        blurMethod="dimezisBlurView">
        <Text style={styles.text}>{text}</Text>
      </BlurView>
      <BlurView
        blurTarget={targetRef}
        intensity={80}
        tint="light"
        style={styles.blurContainer}
        blurMethod="dimezisBlurView">
        <Text style={styles.text}>{text}</Text>
      </BlurView>
      <BlurView

## Android support

The blurring feature is stable on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind when migrating:

### API

To blur the background of a view on Android, wrap the content to be blurred in a `BlurTargetView` component and pass its ref to the `BlurView`. You can see an example in the [Usage](/versions/latest/sdk/blur-view#basic-blurview-usage-with-android-support) section.

### Performance

The blur can be achieved efficiently only by using the [RenderNode](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/RenderNode) Android API, which was introduced in Android SDK 31 (Android 9.0). Due to this, on older versions of Android `expo-blur` uses the much less efficient [RenderScript](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/renderscript/compute) API. If you want to avoid the performance penalty on older platforms you can use the `dimezisBlurViewSdk31Plus` [BlurMethod](/versions/latest/sdk/blur-view#blurmethod-1) which will only blur on newer versions of Android and fall back to the [`none`](/versions/latest/sdk/blur-view#blurmethod-1) on older versions.

## API

```js
import { BlurView } from 'expo-blur';
```

## Components

### `BlurView`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: React.[Component](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component)<[BlurViewProps](#blurviewprops), BlurViewState\>

BlurViewProps

### `blurMethod`

Supported platforms: Android.

Optional • Type: [BlurMethod](#blurmethod) • Default: `'none'`

Blur method to use on Android.

### `blurReductionFactor`

Supported platforms: Android.

Optional • Type: `number` • Default: `4`

A number by which the blur intensity will be divided on Android.

When using experimental blur methods on Android, the perceived blur intensity might differ from iOS at different intensity levels. This property can be used to fine tune it on Android to match it more closely with iOS.

### `blurTarget`

Supported platforms: Android.

Optional • Type: [RefObject](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef)<[View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view) | null\>

A ref to a BlurTargetView, which this BlurView will blur as its background.

### `intensity`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `number` • Default: `50`

A number from `1` to `100` to control the intensity of the blur effect.

You can animate this property using `react-native-reanimated`.

### `tint`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: [BlurTint](#blurtint) • Default: `'default'`

A tint mode which will be applied to the view.

#### Inherited Props

-   [ViewProps](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#props)

### `BlurTargetView`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: React.[Element](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#function-component)<[BlurTargetViewProps](#blurtargetviewprops)\>

BlurTargetViewProps

### `ref`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: [RefObject](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef)<[View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view) | null\>

#### Inherited Props

-   [ViewProps](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#props)

## Types

### `BlurMethod`

Supported platforms: Android.

Literal Type: `string`

Blur method to use on Android.

-   `'none'` - Renders a semi-transparent view instead of rendering a blur effect.
    
-   `'dimezisBlurView'` - Uses a native blur view implementation based on [BlurView](https://github.com/Dimezis/BlurView) library. This method may lead to decreased performance on Android SDK 30 and below.
    
-   `'dimezisBlurViewSdk31Plus'` - Uses a native blur view implementation based on [BlurView](https://github.com/Dimezis/BlurView) library on Android SDK 31 and above, for older versions of Android falls back to 'none'. This is due to performance limitations on older versions of Android, see the [performance](#performance) section to learn more.
    

Acceptable values are: `'none'` | `'dimezisBlurView'` | `'dimezisBlurViewSdk31Plus'`

### `BlurTint`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Literal Type: `string`

Acceptable values are: `'light'` | `'dark'` | `'default'` | `'extraLight'` | `'regular'` | `'prominent'` | `'systemUltraThinMaterial'` | `'systemThinMaterial'` | `'systemMaterial'` | `'systemThickMaterial'` | `'systemChromeMaterial'` | `'systemUltraThinMaterialLight'` | `'systemThinMaterialLight'` | `'systemMaterialLight'` | `'systemThickMaterialLight'` | `'systemChromeMaterialLight'` | `'systemUltraThinMaterialDark'` | `'systemThinMaterialDark'` | `'systemMaterialDark'` | `'systemThickMaterialDark'` | `'systemChromeMaterialDark'`

## Using `borderRadius` with `BlurView`

When using `BlurView` on Android and iOS, the `borderRadius` property is not applied when provided explicitly. To fix this, you can use the `overflow: 'hidden'` style since `BlurView` inherits props from `<View>`. See [Usage](/versions/latest/sdk/blur-view#usage) for an example.

# Expo Brightness

A library that provides access to an API for getting and setting the screen brightness.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

An API to get and set screen brightness.

On Android, there is a global system-wide brightness setting, and each app has its own brightness setting that can optionally override the global setting. It is possible to set either of these values with this API. On iOS, the system brightness setting cannot be changed programmatically; instead, any changes to the screen brightness will persist until the device is locked or powered off.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-brightness
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using a native **android** project manually, then you need to add the `android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS` permission to the **AndroidManifest.xml** file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS" />
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from 'react-native';
import * as Brightness from 'expo-brightness';

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Brightness.requestPermissionsAsync();
      if (status === 'granted') {
        Brightness.setSystemBrightnessAsync(1);
      }
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Brightness Module Example</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

## API

```js
import * as Brightness from 'expo-brightness';
```

# Expo Brownfield

Toolkit and APIs for integrating Expo into existing native applications.
Android, iOS

`expo-brownfield` is a toolkit for adding React Native views to existing native Android and iOS applications. It provides:

-   **Built-in APIs** for bi-directional communication and navigation between native and React Native apps
-   **Config plugin** for automatic setup of brownfield targets in your Expo project
-   **CLI** for building and publishing artifacts to Maven repositories (Android) and XCFrameworks (iOS)

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-brownfield
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Communication API

The Communication API enables bi-directional, message-based communication between the native (host) app and React Native.

#### Sending messages from React Native to native

```typescript
import * as Brownfield from 'expo-brownfield';

Brownfield.sendMessage({
  type: 'MyMessage',
  data: {
    language: 'TypeScript',
    expo: true,
    platforms: ['android', 'ios'],
  },
});
```

#### Receiving messages from native in React Native

```typescript
import * as Brownfield, { type MessageEvent } from 'expo-brownfield';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleMessage = (event: MessageEvent) => {
      console.log('Received message:', event);
    };

    Brownfield.addMessageListener(handleMessage);

    return () => {
      Brownfield.removeMessageListener(handleMessage);
    };
  }, []);

  // ...
}
```

#### Sending messages from native to React Native

```kotlin
import expo.modules.brownfield.BrownfieldMessaging

BrownfieldMessaging.sendMessage(mapOf(
    "type" to "MyAndroidMessage",
    "timestamp" to System.currentTimeMillis(),
    "data" to mapOf(
        "platform" to "android"
    )
))
```

#### Receiving messages from React Native in native

```kotlin
import expo.modules.brownfield.BrownfieldMessaging

val listenerId = BrownfieldMessaging.addListener { event ->
    println("Message from React Native: $event")
}

// Later, to remove the listener:
BrownfieldMessaging.removeListener(listenerId)
```

## Configuration in app config

The `expo-brownfield` package provides a [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) that can be used to configure the brownfield integration when using [Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation). This plugin allows you to customize how your Expo project is packaged and integrated into your existing native app.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-brownfield",
        {
          "ios": {
            "targetName": "MyBrownfieldTarget",
            "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.brownfield"
          },
          "android": {
            "group": "com.example",
            "libraryName": "brownfield",
            "package": "com.example.brownfield",
            "version": "1.0.0"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

# Expo BuildProperties

A config plugin that allows customizing native build properties during prebuild.
Android, iOS, tvOS

`expo-build-properties` is a [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) configuring the native build properties of your **android/gradle.properties** and **ios/Podfile.properties.json** directories during [Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild).

> This config plugin configures how [Prebuild command](/workflow/prebuild) generates the native **android** and **ios** directories and therefore cannot be used with projects that don't run `npx expo prebuild` (bare projects).

## Installation

```sh

# Expo Calendar (next)

A library that provides an API for interacting with the device's system calendars, events, reminders, and associated records.
Android (device only), iOS (device only)

> The `next` version of the Calendar API is included in the `expo-calendar` library. It can be used alongside the previous API, and offers a simplified, object oriented way of performing calendar operations.

> To provide quicker updates, `expo-calendar/next` is currently unsupported in Expo Go and Snack. To use it, create a [development build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build).

`expo-calendar` provides an API for interacting with the device's system calendars, events, reminders, and associated records.

Additionally, it provides methods to launch the [system-provided calendar UI](/versions/latest/sdk/calendar-next#launching-system-provided-calendar-dialogs) to allow the user to view or edit events. On iOS, they present either [`EKEventViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/eventkitui/ekeventviewcontroller) or [`EKEventEditViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/eventkitui/ekeventeditviewcontroller) as a modal.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-calendar
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-calendar` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-calendar",
        {
          "calendarPermission": "The app needs to access your calendar."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `calendarPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your calendar"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the [`NSCalendarsUsageDescription`](#ios) permission message. |
| `remindersPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your reminders"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the [`NSRemindersUsageDescription`](#ios) permission message. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) (you're using native **ios** project manually), then you need to configure following permissions in your native project:

-   For iOS, add `NSCalendarsUsageDescription` and `NSRemindersUsageDescription` to your project's **ios/[app]/Info.plist**:
    
    ```xml
    <key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your calendar</string>
    <key>NSRemindersUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your reminders</string>
    ```

## Usage

```jsx
import * as Calendar from 'expo-calendar/next';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const BasicUsage = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Calendar.requestCalendarPermissions();
      if (status === 'granted') {
        const calendars = Calendar.getCalendars(Calendar.EntityTypes.EVENT);
        console.log('Here are all your calendars:');
        console.log(JSON.stringify(calendars));
      }
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Calendar Module Example</Text>
      <Button title="Create a new calendar" onPress={createCalendar} />
    </View>
  );
};

async function createCalendar() {
  const newCalendar = await Calendar.createCalendar({
    title: 'Expo Calendar',
    color: 'blue',
    entityType: Calendar.EntityTypes.EVENT,
  });
  console.log(`Your new calendar: ${JSON.stringify(newCalendar)}`);
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'space-around',
  },
});
```

## API

```js
import * as Calendar from 'expo-calendar/next';
```

Unless specified otherwise, all dates are returned in the ISO 8601 format.

## Permissions

### Android

If you only intend to use the [system-provided calendar UI](/versions/latest/sdk/calendar-next#launching-system-provided-calendar-dialogs), you don't need to request any permissions.

Otherwise, you must add the following permissions to your **app.json** inside the [`expo.android.permissions`](/versions/latest/config/app#permissions) array.

| Android Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `READ_CALENDAR` | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data. |
| `WRITE_CALENDAR` | Allows an application to write the user's calendar data. |

### iOS

If you only intend to create events using system-provided calendar UI with [`createEventInCalendarAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/calendar-next#createeventincalendarasynceventdata-presentationoptions), you don't need to request permissions.

The following usage description keys are used by this library:

| Info.plist Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NSCalendarsUsageDescription` | A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the user’s calendar data. |
| `NSRemindersUsageDescription` | A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the user’s reminders. |

# Expo Calendar

A library that provides an API for interacting with the device's system calendars, events, reminders, and associated records.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

`expo-calendar` provides an API for interacting with the device's system calendars, events, reminders, and associated records.

Additionally, it provides methods to launch the [system-provided calendar UI](/versions/latest/sdk/calendar#launching-system-provided-calendar-dialogs) to allow user view or edit events. On Android, these methods start the system calendar app using an Intent. On iOS, they present either [`EKEventViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/eventkitui/ekeventviewcontroller) or [`EKEventEditViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/eventkitui/ekeventeditviewcontroller) as a modal.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-calendar
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-calendar` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-calendar",
        {
          "calendarPermission": "The app needs to access your calendar."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `calendarPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your calendar"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the [`NSCalendarsUsageDescription`](#ios) permission message. |
| `remindersPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your reminders"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the [`NSRemindersUsageDescription`](#ios) permission message. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) (you're using native **android** and **ios** projects manually), then you need to configure following permissions in your native projects:

-   For Android, add `android.permission.READ_CALENDAR` and `android.permission.WRITE_CALENDAR` permissions to your project's **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**:
    
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CALENDAR" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CALENDAR" />
    ```
    
-   For iOS, add `NSCalendarsUsageDescription` and `NSRemindersUsageDescription` to your project's **ios/[app]/Info.plist**:
    
    ```xml
    <key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your calendar</string>
    <key>NSRemindersUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your reminders</string>
    ```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View, Text, Button, Platform } from 'react-native';
import * as Calendar from 'expo-calendar';

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Calendar.requestCalendarPermissionsAsync();
      if (status === 'granted') {
        const calendars = await Calendar.getCalendarsAsync(Calendar.EntityTypes.EVENT);
        console.log('Here are all your calendars:');
        console.log({ calendars });
      }
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Calendar Module Example</Text>
      <Button title="Create a new calendar" onPress={createCalendar} />
    </View>
  );
}

async function getDefaultCalendarSource() {
  const defaultCalendar = await Calendar.getDefaultCalendarAsync();
  return defaultCalendar.source;
}

async function createCalendar() {
  const defaultCalendarSource =
    Platform.OS === 'ios'
      ? await getDefaultCalendarSource()
      : { isLocalAccount: true, name: 'Expo Calendar' };
  const newCalendarID = await Calendar.createCalendarAsync({
    title: 'Expo Calendar',
    color: 'blue',
    entityType: Calendar.EntityTypes.EVENT,
    sourceId: defaultCalendarSource.id,
    source: defaultCalendarSource,
    name: 'internalCalendarName',
    ownerAccount: 'personal',
    accessLevel: Calendar.CalendarAccessLevel.OWNER,
  });
  console.log(`Your new calendar ID is: ${newCalendarID}`);
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'space-around',
  },
});
```

## Permissions

### Android

If you only intend to use the [system-provided calendar UI](/versions/latest/sdk/calendar#launching-system-provided-calendar-dialogs), you don't need to request any permissions.

Otherwise, you must add the following permissions to your **app.json** inside the [`expo.android.permissions`](/versions/latest/config/app#permissions) array.

| Android Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `READ_CALENDAR` | Allows an application to read the user's calendar data. |
| `WRITE_CALENDAR` | Allows an application to write the user's calendar data. |

### iOS

If you only intend to create events using system-provided calendar UI with [`createEventInCalendarAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/calendar#createeventincalendarasynceventdata-presentationoptions), you don't need to request permissions.

The following usage description keys are used by this library:

| Info.plist Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NSCalendarsUsageDescription` | A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the user’s calendar data. |
| `NSRemindersUsageDescription` | A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the user’s reminders. |

# Expo Camera

A React component that renders a preview for the device's front or back camera.
Android (device only), iOS (device only), Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-camera` provides a React component that renders a preview of the device's front or back camera. The camera's parameters such as zoom, torch, and flash mode are adjustable. Using `CameraView`, you can take photos and record videos that are saved to the app's cache. The component is also capable of detecting bar codes appearing in the preview. Run the [example](/versions/latest/sdk/camera#usage) on your device to see all these features working together.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-camera
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-camera` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-camera",
        {
          "cameraPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera",
          "microphonePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone",
          "recordAudioAndroid": true,
          "barcodeScannerEnabled": true
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cameraPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the [`NSCameraUsageDescription`](#ios) permission message. |
| `microphonePermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the [`NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`](#ios) permission message. |
| `recordAudioAndroid` | `true` | Only for: Android. A boolean that determines whether to enable the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission on Android. |
| `barcodeScannerEnabled` | `true` | A boolean that determines whether to enable barcode scanning support. Disabling this reduces app size when barcode scanning is not needed. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) (you're using native **android** and **ios** projects manually), then you need to configure following permissions in your native projects:

**Android**

-   `expo-camera` automatically adds `android.permission.CAMERA` permission to your project's **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**. If you want to record videos with audio, include `RECORD_AUDIO` permission:
    
    ```xml
    <!-- Added permission -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
    
    <!-- Only add when recording videos with audio -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    ```
    
-   Then, adjust the **android/build.gradle** file to add new maven block after all other repositories as show below:
    
    ```groovy
    allprojects {
      repositories {
          // * Your other repositories here *
          // * Add a new maven block after other repositories / blocks *
          maven {
              // expo-camera bundles a custom com.google.android:cameraview
              url "$rootDir/../node_modules/expo-camera/android/maven"
          }
      }
    }
    ```
    

**iOS**

-   Add `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` keys to your project's **ios/[app]/Info.plist**:
    
    ```xml
    <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera</string>
    <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone</string>
    ```

## Usage

> Only one Camera preview can be active at any given time. If you have multiple screens in your app, you should unmount `Camera` components whenever a screen is unfocused.

```tsx
import { CameraView, CameraType, useCameraPermissions } from 'expo-camera';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Button, StyleSheet, Text, TouchableOpacity, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  const [facing, setFacing] = useState<CameraType>('back');
  const [permission, requestPermission] = useCameraPermissions();

  if (!permission) {
    // Camera permissions are still loading.
    return <View />;
  }

  if (!permission.granted) {
    // Camera permissions are not granted yet.
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.message}>We need your permission to show the camera</Text>
        <Button onPress={requestPermission} title="grant permission" />
      </View>
    );
  }

  function toggleCameraFacing() {
    setFacing(current => (current === 'back' ? 'front' : 'back'));
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <CameraView style={styles.camera} facing={facing} />
      <View style={styles.buttonContainer}>
        <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button} onPress={toggleCameraFacing}>
          <Text style={styles.text}>Flip Camera</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  message: {
    textAlign: 'center',
    paddingBottom: 10,
  },
  camera: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  buttonContainer: {
    position: 'absolute',
    bottom: 64,
    flexDirection: 'row',
    backgroundColor: 'transparent',
    width: '100%',
    paddingHorizontal: 64,
  },
  button: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: 'white',
  },
});
```

### Advanced usage

[Camera app example](https://github.com/expo/examples/tree/master/with-camera) — A complete example that shows how to take a picture and display it. Written in TypeScript.

## Web support

Most browsers support a version of web camera functionality, you can check out the [web camera browser support here](https://caniuse.com/#feat=stream). Image URIs are always returned as base64 strings because local file system paths are unavailable in the browser.

### Chrome `iframe` usage

When using **Chrome versions 64+**, if you try to use a web camera in a cross-origin iframe nothing will render. To add support for cameras in your iframe simply add the attribute `allow="microphone; camera;"` to the iframe element:

```html
<iframe src="..." allow="microphone; camera;">
  <!-- <CameraView /> -->
</iframe>
```

```js
import { CameraView } from 'expo-camera';

Although enabling this option reduces image delivery time significantly, it may cause the image to appear in a wrong orientation in the `Image` component (at the time of writing, it does not respect EXIF orientation of the images). Note: Enabling skipProcessing would cause orientation uncertainty. Image component does not respect EXIF stored orientation information, that means obtained image would be displayed wrongly (rotated by 90°, 180° or 270°). Different devices provide different orientations. For example some Sony Xperia or Samsung devices don't provide correctly oriented images by default. To always obtain correctly oriented image disable skipProcessing option. |

title: react-native-view-shot
description: A library that allows you to capture a React Native view and save it as an image.
sourceCodeUrl: 'https://github.com/gre/react-native-view-shot'
packageName: react-native-view-shot
platforms: ['android', 'ios', 'expo-go']
inExpoGo: true
---

# react-native-view-shot

A library that allows you to capture a React Native view and save it as an image.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

Given a view, `captureRef` will essentially screenshot that view and return an image for you. This is very useful for things like signature pads, where the user draws something, and then you want to save an image from it.

If you're interested in taking snapshots from the GLView, we recommend you use [GLView's takeSnapshotAsync](/versions/latest/sdk/gl-view#takesnapshotasyncoptions) instead.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install react-native-view-shot
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project. Then, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/gre/react-native-view-shot) provided in the library's README or documentation.

## Note on pixel values

Remember to take the device `PixelRatio` into account. When you work with pixel values in a UI, most of the time those units are "logical pixels" or "device-independent pixels". With images like PNG files, you often work with "physical pixels". You can get the `PixelRatio` of the device using the React Native API: `PixelRatio.get()`

For example, to save a 'FullHD' picture of `1080x1080`, you would do something like this:

```js
const targetPixelCount = 1080; // If you want full HD pictures
const pixelRatio = PixelRatio.get(); // The pixel ratio of the device
// pixels * pixelRatio = targetPixelCount, so pixels = targetPixelCount / pixelRatio
const pixels = targetPixelCount / pixelRatio;

const result = await captureRef(this.imageContainer, {
  result: 'tmpfile',
  height: pixels,
  width: pixels,
  quality: 1,
  format: 'png',
});
```

# Expo Cellular

An API that provides information about the user's cellular service provider.
Android, iOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-cellular` provides information about the user's cellular service provider, such as its unique identifier, cellular connection type, and whether it allows VoIP calls on its network.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-cellular
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using native a **android** project manually, then you need to add `android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE` permission to your project's **AndroidManifest.xml**. This permission is used for `TelephonyManager`.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
```

This library does not require the more risky `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` permission.

## API

```js
import * as Cellular from 'expo-cellular';
```

## Hooks

### `usePermissions(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | `PermissionHookOptions<object>` |

  

Check or request permissions to access the phone state. This uses both `Cellular.requestPermissionsAsync` and `Cellular.getPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns: `[PermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<permissionresponse>, GetPermissionMethod]</permissionresponse>`

Example

```ts
const [status, requestPermission] = Cellular.usePermissions();
```

## Methods

### `Cellular.allowsVoipAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

Returns if the carrier allows making VoIP calls on its network. On Android, this checks whether the system supports SIP-based VoIP API. See [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/sip/SipManager.html#isVoipSupported\(android.content.Context\)) to view more information.

On iOS, if you configure a device for a carrier and then remove the SIM card, this property retains the `boolean` value indicating the carrier’s policy regarding VoIP. If you then install a new SIM card, its VoIP policy `boolean` replaces the previous value of this property.

On iOS and web, this returns `null`.

Example

```ts
await Cellular.allowsVoipAsync(); // true or false
```

### `Cellular.getCarrierNameAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android.

Returns: `Promise<string>`

Returns name of the user’s home cellular service provider. If the device has dual SIM cards, only the carrier for the currently active SIM card is returned.

On Android, this value is only available when the SIM state is [`SIM_STATE_READY`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager.html#SIM_STATE_READY). Otherwise, this returns `null`.

On iOS and web, this returns `null`.

Example

```ts
await Cellular.getCarrierNameAsync(); // "T-Mobile" or "Verizon"
```

### `Cellular.getCellularGenerationAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Returns: `Promise<cellulargeneration>`

Returns a promise which fulfils with a [`Cellular.CellularGeneration`](#cellulargeneration) enum value that represents the current cellular-generation type.

You need to check if the native permission has been accepted to obtain generation. If the permission is denied, `getCellularGenerationAsync` resolves with `Cellular.CellularGeneration.UNKNOWN`.

On web, this method uses [`navigator.connection.effectiveType`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NetworkInformation/effectiveType) to detect the effective type of the connection using a combination of recently observed round-trip time and downlink values. See [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API) to view browser compatibility.

Example

```ts
await Cellular.getCellularGenerationAsync();
// CellularGeneration.CELLULAR_4G
```

### `Cellular.getIsoCountryCodeAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android.

Returns: `Promise<string>`

Returns the ISO country code for the user’s cellular service provider.

On iOS, the value is `null` if any of the following apply:

-   The device is in airplane mode.
-   There is no SIM card in the device.
-   The device is outside of cellular service range.

On iOS and web, this returns `null`.

Example

```ts
await Cellular.getIsoCountryCodeAsync(); // "us" or "au"
```

### `Cellular.getMobileCountryCodeAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android.

Returns: `Promise<string>`

Returns mobile country code (MCC) for the user’s current registered cellular service provider.

On Android, this value is only available when SIM state is [`SIM_STATE_READY`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager.html#SIM_STATE_READY). Otherwise, this returns `null`. On iOS, the value may be null on hardware prior to iPhone 4S when in airplane mode. Furthermore, the value for this property is `null` if any of the following apply:

-   There is no SIM card in the device.
-   The device is outside of cellular service range.

On iOS and web, this returns `null`.

Example

```ts
await Cellular.getMobileCountryCodeAsync(); // "310"
```

### `Cellular.getMobileNetworkCodeAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android.

Returns: `Promise<string>`

Returns the mobile network code (MNC) for the user’s current registered cellular service provider.

On Android, this value is only available when SIM state is [`SIM_STATE_READY`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager.html#SIM_STATE_READY). Otherwise, this returns `null`. On iOS, the value may be null on hardware prior to iPhone 4S when in airplane mode. Furthermore, the value for this property is `null` if any of the following apply:

-   There is no SIM card in the device.
-   The device is outside of cellular service range.

On iOS and web, this returns `null`.

Example

```ts
await Cellular.getMobileNetworkCodeAsync(); // "310"
```

### `Cellular.getPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Checks user's permissions for accessing phone state.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

### `Cellular.requestPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing the phone state.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

## Enums

### `CellularGeneration`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

# Expo Clipboard

A universal library that allows getting and setting Clipboard content.
Android, iOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-clipboard` provides an interface for getting and setting Clipboard content on Android, iOS, and Web.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-clipboard
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import * as Clipboard from 'expo-clipboard';

export default function App() {
  const [copiedText, setCopiedText] = useState('');

  const copyToClipboard = async () => {
    await Clipboard.setStringAsync('hello world');
  };

  const fetchCopiedText = async () => {
    const text = await Clipboard.getStringAsync();
    setCopiedText(text);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Click here to copy to Clipboard" onPress={copyToClipboard} />
      <Button title="View copied text" onPress={fetchCopiedText} />
      <Text style={styles.copiedText}>{copiedText}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  copiedText: {
    marginTop: 10,
    color: 'red',
  },
});
```

## API

```js
import * as Clipboard from 'expo-clipboard';
```

> On Web, this module uses the [`AsyncClipboard` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API), which might behave differently between browsers or not be fully supported. Especially on WebKit, there's an issue which makes this API unusable in asynchronous code. [Click here for more details](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=222262).

## Component

### `ClipboardPasteButton`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Type: React.Element<[ClipboardPasteButtonProps](#clipboardpastebuttonprops)\>

This component displays the `UIPasteControl` button on your screen. This allows pasting from the clipboard without requesting permission from the user.

You should only attempt to render this if [`Clipboard.isPasteButtonAvailable`](#ispastebuttonavailable) is `true`. This component will render nothing if it is not available, and you will get a warning in development mode (`__DEV__ === true`).

The properties of this component extend from `View`; however, you should not attempt to set `backgroundColor`, `color` or `borderRadius` with the `style` property. Apple restricts customisation of this view. Instead, you should use the backgroundColor and foregroundColor properties to set the colors of the button, the cornerStyle property to change the border radius, and the displayMode property to change the appearance of the icon and label. The word "Paste" is not editable and neither is the icon.

Make sure to attach height and width via the style props as without these styles, the button will not appear on the screen.

> **See:** [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uipastecontrol) for more details.

Example

```ts
onPress={(data) => {
    if (data.type === 'image') {
      setImageData(data);
   } else {
      setTextData(data);
    }
  }}
```

### `style`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Optional • Type: StyleProp<[Omit](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#omittype-keys)<[ViewStyle](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props), 'backgroundColor' | 'borderRadius' | 'color'\>\>

The custom style to apply to the button. Should not include `backgroundColor`, `borderRadius` or `color` properties.

#### Inherited Props

## Constants

### `isPasteButtonAvailable`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Type: `boolean`

Property that determines if the `ClipboardPasteButton` is available.

This requires the users device to be using at least iOS 16.

`true` if the component is available, and `false` otherwise.

## Methods

### `getImageAsync(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `options` | [GetImageOptions](#getimageoptions) | A `GetImageOptions` object to specify the desired format of the image. |

  

Gets the image from the user's clipboard and returns it in the specified format. Calling this method on web will prompt the user to grant your app permission to "see text and images copied to the clipboard."

Note: On iOS 16+, if the user denies paste permission, this method will return null. Due to iOS platform limitations, there is no way to distinguish between no image in clipboard and denied permission.

Returns: `Promise<clipboardimage>`

If there was an image in the clipboard, the promise resolves to a [`ClipboardImage`](#clipboardimage) object containing the base64 string and metadata of the image. Otherwise, it resolves to `null` (this includes cases where permission was denied).

Example

```tsx
const img = await Clipboard.getImageAsync({ format: 'png' });
// ...
<Image source={{ uri: img?.data }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
```

### `getStringAsync(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | [GetStringOptions](#getstringoptions) | Options for the clipboard content to be retrieved. Default: `{}` |

  

Gets the content of the user's clipboard. Calling this method on web will prompt the user to grant your app permission to "see text and images copied to the clipboard."

Note: On iOS 16+, if the user denies paste permission, this method will return an empty string. Due to iOS platform limitations, there is no way to distinguish between an empty clipboard and denied permission.

Returns: `Promise<string>`

A promise that resolves to the content of the clipboard, or an empty string if clipboard is empty or permission was denied.

### `getUrlAsync()`

Supported platforms: iOS.

Gets the URL from the user's clipboard.

Note: On iOS 16+, if the user denies paste permission, this method will return null. Due to iOS platform limitations, there is no way to distinguish between no URL in clipboard and denied permission.

Returns: `Promise<string>`

A promise that fulfills to the URL in the clipboard, or null if no URL is present or permission was denied.

### `hasImageAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Returns whether the clipboard has an image content.

On web, this requires the user to grant your app permission to _"see text and images copied to the clipboard"_.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

A promise that fulfills to `true` if clipboard has image content, resolves to `false` otherwise.

### `hasStringAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Returns whether the clipboard has text content. Returns true for both plain text and rich text (e.g. HTML).

On web, this requires the user to grant your app permission to _"see text and images copied to the clipboard"_.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

A promise that fulfills to `true` if clipboard has text content, resolves to `false` otherwise.

### `hasUrlAsync()`

Supported platforms: iOS.

Returns whether the clipboard has a URL content.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

A promise that fulfills to `true` if clipboard has URL content, resolves to `false` otherwise.

Example

```tsx
const result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
  mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,
  base64: true,
});
await Clipboard.setImageAsync(result.base64);
```

> **Deprecated:** Use [`setStringAsync()`](#setstringasynctext-options) instead.

### `setString(text)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `text` | `string` |

  

Sets the content of the user's clipboard.

Returns: `void`

On web, this returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the string was saved to the user's clipboard. On iOS and Android, nothing is returned.

### `setStringAsync(text, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | `string` | The string to save to the clipboard. |

Returns: `Promise<void>`

## Event Subscriptions

### `addClipboardListener(listener)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listener` | (event: [ClipboardEvent](#clipboardevent)) => void | Callback to execute when listener is triggered. The callback is provided a single argument that is an object containing information about clipboard contents. |

  

Adds a listener that will fire whenever the content of the user's clipboard changes. This method is a no-op on Web.

Returns: `EventSubscription`

Example

```typescript
Clipboard.addClipboardListener(({ contentTypes }: ClipboardEvent) => {
  if (contentTypes.includes(Clipboard.ContentType.PLAIN_TEXT)) {
    Clipboard.getStringAsync().then(content => {
      alert('Copy pasta! Here\'s the string that was copied: ' + content)
    });
  } else if (contentTypes.includes(Clipboard.ContentType.IMAGE)) {

# Expo Contacts (next)

A library that provides access to the phone's system contacts.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

`expo-contacts` provides access to the device's system contacts, allowing you to get contact information as well as add, edit, or remove contacts. On iOS, contacts have a multi-layered grouping system that you can also access through this API.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-contacts
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-contacts` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-contacts",
        {

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contactsPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your contacts"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the [`NSContactsUsageDescription`](#ios) permission message. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) (you're using native **android** and **ios** projects manually), then you need to configure following permissions in your native projects:

-   For Android, add `android.permission.READ_CONTACTS` and `android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS` permissions to your project's **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**:
    
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS" />
    ```
    
-   For iOS, add the `NSContactsUsageDescription` key to your project's **ios/[app]/Info.plist**:
    
    ```xml
    <key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your contacts</string>
    ```

## Usage

Contacts Manipulations

```tsx
const contact = await Contact.create({ givenName: 'John', familyName: 'Doe' });
// { givenName: "John", familyName: "Doe"}

await contact.setGivenName('Andrew');
// { givenName: "Andrew", familyName: "Doe"}

await contact.addPhone({ label: 'work', number: '+12345678912' });
// { givenName: "Andrew", familyName: "Doe", phones: [{label: "work", number: "+12345678912"}]}

const phones = await contact.getPhones();
// Changes only the defined fields, leaves the rest unchanged
await contact.patch({ phones: [...phones, { label: 'home', number: '+98765432198' }] });
/*
{
  givenName: "Andrew",
  familyName: "Doe",
  phones: [
    {label: "work", number: "+12345678912"},
    {label: "home", number: "+98765432198"}
  ]
}
*/

// Replaces all fields with the ones defined in the object
await contact.update({ givenName: 'John', familyName: 'Doe' });
// { givenName: "John", familyName: "Doe"}
```
Retrieving contacts

```tsx
const contactDetails = await Contact.getAllDetails([ContactField.FULL_NAME, ContactField.PHONES], {
  limit: 20,
  offset: 10,
  sortOrder: ContactsSortOrder.GivenName,
});

// Contact instance can be created from fetched details
const contacts = contactDetails.map(item => new Contact(item.id));

const contactsFromGetAll = await Contact.getAll({
  limit: 20,
  offset: 10,
  sortOrder: ContactsSortOrder.GivenName,
});
```

sourceCodeUrl: 'https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-contacts'

# Expo Contacts

A library that provides access to the phone's system contacts.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

`expo-contacts` provides access to the device's system contacts, allowing you to get contact information as well as adding, editing, or removing contacts.

On iOS, contacts have a multi-layered grouping system that you can also access through this API.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-contacts
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-contacts` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-contacts",
        {
          "contactsPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your contacts."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contactsPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your contacts"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the [`NSContactsUsageDescription`](#ios) permission message. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) (you're using native **android** and **ios** projects manually), then you need to configure following permissions in your native projects:

-   For Android, add `android.permission.READ_CONTACTS` and `android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS` permissions to your project's **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**:
    
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS" />

Adds a listener for contact changes. The listener will be called whenever contacts are added, updated, or deleted.

**Platform differences:**

-   **Android**: 5-7 second delay - uses `ContentObserver` with inherent system delays
-   **iOS**: Immediate response - uses `CNContactStoreDidChangeNotification`

The Android delay is a system limitation that affects all apps using `ContentObserver` for contacts. This delay is by design to batch notifications for better performance and battery life. For more immediate updates, you can also listen to app state changes and refresh contacts when the app comes to the foreground. This ensures users see the latest contacts when returning from the native Contacts app.

Returns: `EventSubscription`

A subscription object with a `remove` method to stop listening.

Example

```jsx
const subscription = Contacts.addContactChangeListener(() => {
  console.log('Contacts changed - refreshing contact list');
  // Refresh your contact list when changes are detected
  loadContacts();
});

// Later, remove the listener
subscription.remove();
```

# Expo Crypto

A universal library for crypto operations.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-crypto` enables you to hash data in an equivalent manner to the Node.js core `crypto` API, and perform crypto operations such as AES encryption and decryption.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-crypto
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from 'react-native';
import * as Crypto from 'expo-crypto';

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const digest = await Crypto.digestStringAsync(
        Crypto.CryptoDigestAlgorithm.SHA256,
        'GitHub stars are neat 🌟'
      );
      console.log('Digest: ', digest);
      /* Some crypto operation... */
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Crypto Module Example</Text>
    </View>

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const plaintext = 'Hello, world!';
      const plaintextBase64 = btoa(plaintext);

      const encryptionKey = await AESEncryptionKey.generate();
      const sealedData = await aesEncryptAsync(plaintextBase64, key);
      const decryptedBase64 = await aesDecryptAsync(sealedData, key, {
        output: 'base64',
      });

      const decrypted = atob(decryptedBase64);
      console.log('Decrypted: ', decrypted);
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Crypto Module Example</Text>
    </View>
  );

| `algorithm` | [CryptoDigestAlgorithm](#cryptodigestalgorithm) | The cryptographic hash function to use to transform a block of data into a fixed-size output. |
| `data` | `BufferSource` | The value that will be used to generate a digest. |

  

The `digest()` method of `Crypto` generates a digest of the supplied `TypedArray` of bytes `data` with the provided digest `algorithm`. A digest is a short fixed-length value derived from some variable-length input. **Cryptographic digests** should exhibit _collision-resistance_, meaning that it's very difficult to generate multiple inputs that have equal digest values. On web, this method can only be called from a secure origin (HTTPS) otherwise, an error will be thrown.

Returns: `Promise<arraybuffer>`

A Promise which fulfills with an ArrayBuffer representing the hashed input.

Example

```ts
const array = new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
const digest = await Crypto.digest(Crypto.CryptoDigestAlgorithm.SHA512, array);
console.log('Your digest: ' + digest);
```

### `Crypto.digestStringAsync(algorithm, data, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| `data` | `string` | The value that will be used to generate a digest. |
| `options`(optional) | [CryptoDigestOptions](#cryptodigestoptions) | Format of the digest string. Defaults to: `CryptoDigestOptions.HEX`. |

  

The `digestStringAsync()` method of `Crypto` generates a digest of the supplied `data` string with the provided digest `algorithm`. A digest is a short fixed-length value derived from some variable-length input. **Cryptographic digests** should exhibit _collision-resistance_, meaning that it's very difficult to generate multiple inputs that have equal digest values. You can specify the returned string format as one of `CryptoEncoding`. By default, the resolved value will be formatted as a `HEX` string. On web, this method can only be called from a secure origin (HTTPS) otherwise, an error will be thrown.

Returns: `Promise<string>`

Return a Promise which fulfills with a value representing the hashed input.

Example

```ts
const digest = await Crypto.digestStringAsync(
  Crypto.CryptoDigestAlgorithm.SHA512,
  '🥓 Easy to Digest! 💙'

# Expo DevClient

A library that allows creating a development build and includes useful development tools.
Android, iOS, tvOS

`expo-dev-client` adds various useful development tools to your debug builds:

-   A configurable launcher UI, so you can launch updates (such as from [PR previews](/develop/development-builds/development-workflows#pr-previews)) and switch between development servers without needing to recompile the native app
-   Improved debugging tools (such as support for [inspecting network requests](/debugging/tools#inspecting-network-requests))
-   [A powerful and extensible developer menu UI](/debugging/tools#developer-menu)

Expo documentation refers to debug builds that include `expo-dev-client` as [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-dev-client
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), start by installing [`expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project. Then, follow the instructions from [Install `expo-dev-client` in an existing React Native project](/bare/install-dev-builds-in-bare).

## Configuration in app config

You can configure development client launcher using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-dev-client",
        {
          "launchMode": "most-recent"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `launchMode` | `"most-recent"` | Determines whether to launch the most recently opened project or navigate to the launcher screen.
-   `most-recent` - Attempt to launch directly into a previously opened project and if unable to connect, fall back to the launcher screen.
-   `launcher` - Opens the launcher screen.

 |
| `addGeneratedScheme` | `true` | By default, `expo-dev-client` will register a custom URL scheme to open a project. Set this property to `false` to disable this scheme. |
| `android.launchMode` | `"most-recent"` | Only for: Android. Determines whether to launch the most recently opened project or navigate to the launcher screen on Android. Overrides the top-level `launchMode` setting for Android only.

-   `most-recent` - Attempt to launch directly into a previously opened project and if unable to connect, fall back to the launcher screen.
-   `launcher` - Opens the launcher screen.

 |
| `ios.launchMode` | `"most-recent"` | Only for: iOS. Determines whether to launch the most recently opened project or navigate to the launcher screen on iOS. Overrides the top-level `launchMode` setting for iOS only.

-   `most-recent` - Attempt to launch directly into a previously opened project and if unable to connect, fall back to the launcher screen.
-   `launcher` - Opens the launcher screen.

# Expo DevMenu

A library that provides a developer menu for debug builds.
Android, iOS, tvOS

The `expo-dev-menu` can be used as a **standalone library** in any Expo project. It is especially useful in [brownfield apps](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/brownfield) that don't need the full [`expo-dev-client`](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/dev-client) launcher interface.

`expo-dev-menu` provides a developer menu UI for React Native apps that includes:

-   A powerful and extensible menu UI accessible via shake gesture or three-finger long press
-   Quick access to common development actions
-   Support for custom menu items to extend functionality

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-dev-menu
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

Once installed, the developer menu is available in your debug builds. You can open it by:

-   **Shake gesture**: Shake your device
-   **Three-finger long press**: Long press with three fingers on the screen
-   **Programmatically**: Call `DevMenu.openMenu()` from your code

## Extending the dev menu

The dev menu can be extended to include extra buttons by using the `registerDevMenuItems` API:

```tsx
import { registerDevMenuItems } from 'expo-dev-menu';

const devMenuItems = [
  {
    name: 'My Custom Button',
    callback: () => console.log('Hello world!'),
  },
];

registerDevMenuItems(devMenuItems);
```

This will create a new section in the dev menu that includes the buttons you have registered:

> **Note:** Subsequent calls of `registerDevMenuItems` will override all previous entries.

## Using with expo-dev-client

If you are using [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction), install `expo-dev-client` instead. It includes `expo-dev-menu` along with additional development tools:

-   A configurable launcher UI for switching between development servers
-   Improved debugging tools
-   Support for loading updates from [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction)

```sh
npx expo install expo-dev-client
```

```

### `Device.modelName`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: `string | null`

The human-friendly name of the device model. This is the name that people would typically use to refer to the device rather than a programmatic model identifier. This value of this field may be `null` if it cannot be determined.

Example

```js
Device.modelName; // Android: "Pixel 2"; iOS: "iPhone XS Max"; web: "iPhone", null
```

### `Device.osBuildFingerprint`

Supported platforms: Android.

Type: `string | null`

A string that uniquely identifies the build of the currently running system OS. On Android, it follows this template:

// iOS: null; web: null
```

### `Device.osBuildId`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: `string | null`

The build ID of the OS that more precisely identifies the version of the OS. On Android, this corresponds to `Build.DISPLAY` (not `Build.ID`) and currently is a string as described [here](https://source.android.com/setup/start/build-numbers). On iOS, this corresponds to `kern.osversion` and is the detailed OS version sometimes displayed next to the more human-readable version. On web, this value is always `null`.

Example

```js
Device.osBuildId; // Android: "PSR1.180720.075"; iOS: "16F203"; web: null
```

### `Device.osInternalBuildId`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: `string | null`

The internal build ID of the OS running on the device. On Android, this corresponds to `Build.ID`. On iOS, this is the same value as [`Device.osBuildId`](#deviceosbuildid). On web, this value is always `null`.

> This method is experimental and is not completely reliable. See description below.

Checks whether the device has been rooted (Android) or jailbroken (iOS). This is not completely reliable because there exist solutions to bypass root-detection on both [iOS](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/XCon) and [Android](https://tweakerlinks.com/how-to-bypass-apps-root-detection-in-android-device/). Further, many root-detection checks can be bypassed via reverse engineering.

-   On Android, it's implemented in a way to find all possible files paths that contain the `"su"` executable but some devices that are not rooted may also have this executable. Therefore, there's no guarantee that this method will always return correctly.
-   On iOS, [these jailbreak checks](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Bypassing_Jailbreak_Detection) are used to detect if a device is rooted/jailbroken. However, since there are closed-sourced solutions such as [xCon](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/XCon) that aim to hook every known method and function responsible for informing an application of a jailbroken device, this method may not reliably detect devices that have xCon or similar packages installed.
-   On web, this always resolves to `false` even if the device is rooted.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

Returns a promise that resolves to a `boolean` that specifies whether this device is rooted.

Example

```js
await Device.isRootedExperimentalAsync();
// true or false
```

### `Device.isSideLoadingEnabledAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android.

**Using this method requires you to [add the `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` permission](/versions/latest/config/app#permissions).** Returns whether applications can be installed for this user via the system's [`ACTION_INSTALL_PACKAGE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_INSTALL_PACKAGE) mechanism rather than through the OS's default app store, like Google Play.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

Returns a promise that resolves to a `boolean` that represents whether the calling package is allowed to request package installation.

Example

```js
await Device.isSideLoadingEnabledAsync();
// true or false
```

## Enums

### `DeviceType`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

An enum representing the different types of devices supported by Expo.

#### `UNKNOWN`

`DeviceType.UNKNOWN = 0`

An unrecognized device type.

#### `PHONE`

`DeviceType.PHONE = 1`

Mobile phone handsets, typically with a touch screen and held in one hand.

#### `TABLET`

`DeviceType.TABLET = 2`

# Expo DeviceMotion

A library that provides access to a device's motion and orientation sensors.
Android, iOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`DeviceMotion` from `expo-sensors` provides access to the device motion and orientation sensors. All data is presented in terms of three axes that run through a device. According to portrait orientation: X runs from left to right, Y from bottom to top and Z perpendicularly through the screen from back to front.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-sensors
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `DeviceMotion` from `expo-sensor` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-sensors",
        {
          "motionPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your device motion."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `motionPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your device motion"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the [`NSMotionUsageDescription`](#ios) permission message. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using native **ios** project manually, then you need to configure `NSMotionUsageDescription` key in your native project to access `DeviceMotion` stats:

```xml
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your device motion</string>
```

## API

```js
import { DeviceMotion } from 'expo-sensors';
```

## Constants

### `Gravity`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Type: `number`

Constant value representing standard gravitational acceleration for Earth (`9.80665` m/s^2).

## Classes

### `DeviceMotion`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Type: Class extends [DeviceSensor](/versions/latest/sdk/sensors)<[DeviceMotionMeasurement](#devicemotionmeasurement)\>

A base class for subscribable sensors. The events emitted by this class are measurements specified by the parameter type `Measurement`.

DeviceMotion Properties

### `Gravity`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Type: `number` • Default: `ExponentDeviceMotion.Gravity`

Constant value representing standard gravitational acceleration for Earth (`9.80665` m/s^2).

DeviceMotion Methods

### `addListener(listener)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listener` | Listener<[DeviceMotionMeasurement](#devicemotionmeasurement)\> | A callback that is invoked when a device motion sensor update is available. When invoked, the listener is provided a single argument that is a `DeviceMotionMeasurement` object. |

  

Subscribe for updates to the device motion sensor.

Returns: `EventSubscription`

A subscription that you can call `remove()` on when you would like to unsubscribe the listener.

### `getListenerCount()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Returns the registered listeners count.

Returns: `number`

### `getPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Checks user's permissions for accessing sensor.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

### `hasListeners()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Returns boolean which signifies if sensor has any listeners registered.

Returns: `boolean`

### `isAvailableAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

> You should always check the sensor availability before attempting to use it.

Returns whether the accelerometer is enabled on the device.

On mobile web, you must first invoke `DeviceMotion.requestPermissionsAsync()` in a user interaction (i.e. touch event) before you can use this module. If the `status` is not equal to `granted` then you should inform the end user that they may have to open settings.

On **web** this starts a timer and waits to see if an event is fired. This should predict if the iOS device has the **device orientation** API disabled in **Settings > Safari > Motion & Orientation Access**. Some devices will also not fire if the site isn't hosted with **HTTPS** as `DeviceMotion` is now considered a secure API. There is no formal API for detecting the status of `DeviceMotion` so this API can sometimes be unreliable on web.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

A promise that resolves to a `boolean` denoting the availability of device motion sensor.

### `removeAllListeners()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Removes all registered listeners.

Returns: `void`

> **Deprecated:** use subscription.remove() instead.

### `removeSubscription(subscription)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `subscription` | `EventSubscription` |

  

Returns: `void`

### `requestPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

# Expo DocumentPicker

A library that provides access to the system's UI for selecting documents from the available providers on the user's device.
Android, iOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-document-picker` provides access to the system's UI for selecting documents from the available providers on the user's device.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-document-picker
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-document-picker` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

If you want to enable [iCloud storage features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_icloud-services), set the `expo.ios.usesIcloudStorage` key to `true` in the [app config](/workflow/configuration) file as specified [configuration properties](/versions/latest/config/app#usesicloudstorage).

Running [EAS Build](/build/introduction) locally will use [iOS capabilities signing](/build-reference/ios-capabilities) to enable the required capabilities before building.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-document-picker",
        {
          "iCloudContainerEnvironment": "Production"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `iCloudContainerEnvironment` | `undefined` | Only for: iOS. Sets the iOS `com.apple.developer.icloud-container-environment` entitlement used for AdHoc iOS builds. Possible values: `Development`, `Production`. [Learn more](https://github.com/expo/eas-cli/issues/693). |
| `kvStoreIdentifier` | `undefined` | Only for: iOS. Overrides the default iOS `com.apple.developer.ubiquity-kvstore-identifier` entitlement, which uses your Apple Team ID and bundle identifier. This may be needed if your app was transferred to another Apple Team after enabling iCloud storage. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

Apps that don't use [EAS Build](/build/introduction) and want [iCloud storage features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_icloud-services) must [manually configure](/build-reference/ios-capabilities#manual-setup) the [**iCloud service with CloudKit support**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_icloud-container-environment) for their bundle identifier.

If you enable the **iCloud** capability through the [Apple Developer Console](/build-reference/ios-capabilities#apple-developer-console), then be sure to add the following entitlements in your `ios/[app]/[app].entitlements` file (where `dev.expo.my-app` if your bundle identifier):

```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.icloud-container-identifiers</key>
<array>
    <string>iCloud.dev.expo.my-app</string>
</array>
<key>com.apple.developer.icloud-services</key>
<array>
    <string>CloudDocuments</string>
</array>
<key>com.apple.developer.ubiquity-container-identifiers</key>
<array>
    <string>iCloud.dev.expo.my-app</string>
</array>
<key>com.apple.developer.ubiquity-kvstore-identifier</key>
<string>$(TeamIdentifierPrefix)dev.expo.my-app</string>
```

Apple Developer Console also requires an **iCloud Container** to be created. When registering the new container, you are asked to provide a description and identifier for the container. You may enter any name under the description. Under the identifier, add `iCloud.<your_bundle_identifier>` (same value used for `com.apple.developer.icloud-container-identifiers` and `com.apple.developer.ubiquity-container-identifiers` entitlements).

## Using with `expo-file-system`

When using `expo-document-picker` with [`expo-file-system`](/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem), it's not always possible for the file system to read the file immediately after the `expo-document-picker` picks it.

To allow the `expo-file-system` to read the file immediately after it is picked, you'll need to ensure that the [`copyToCacheDirectory`](/versions/latest/sdk/document-picker#documentpickeroptions) option is set to `true`.

## API

```js
import * as DocumentPicker from 'expo-document-picker';
```

## Component

### `getDocumentAsync`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Type: React.[Element](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#function-component)<[DocumentPickerOptions](#documentpickeroptions)\>

Display the system UI for choosing a document. By default, the chosen file is copied to [the app's internal cache directory](/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem#filesystemcachedirectory).

> **Notes for Web:** The system UI can only be shown after user activation (e.g. a `Button` press). Therefore, calling `getDocumentAsync` in `componentDidMount`, for example, will **not** work as intended. The `cancel` event will not be returned in the browser due to platform restrictions and inconsistencies across browsers.

## Types

### `DocumentPickerAsset`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| base64(optional) | `string` | Supported platforms: Web. Base64 string of the file. |
| file(optional) | [File](#file) | Supported platforms: Web. `File` object for the parity with web File API. |
| lastModified | `number` | Timestamp of last document modification. [Web API specs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/lastModified) The lastModified provides the last modified date of the file as the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970 at midnight). Files without a known last modified date return the current date. |
| mimeType(optional) | `string` | Document MIME type. |
| name | `string` | Document original name. |
| size(optional) | `number` | Document size in bytes. |
| uri | `string` | An URI to the local document file. |

### `DocumentPickerCanceledResult`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Type representing canceled pick result.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| assets | `null` | Always `null` when the request was canceled. |
| canceled | `true` | Always `true` when the request was canceled. |
| output(optional) | `null` | Supported platforms: Web. Always `null` when the request was canceled. |

### `DocumentPickerOptions`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| base64(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: Web. If `true`, asset url is base64 from the file If `false`, asset url is the file url parameter. Default: `true` |
| copyToCacheDirectory(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: Android, iOS. If `true`, the picked file is copied to [`FileSystem.CacheDirectory`](/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem#filesystemcachedirectory), which allows other Expo APIs to read the file immediately. This may impact performance for large files, so you should consider setting this to `false` if you expect users to pick particularly large files and your app does not need immediate read access. Default: `true` |
| multiple(optional) | `boolean` | Allows multiple files to be selected from the system UI. Default: `false` |
| type(optional) | `string | string[]` | The [MIME type(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) of the documents that are available to be picked. It also supports wildcards like `'image/*'` to choose any image. To allow any type of document you can use `'*/*'`. Default: `'*/*'` |

### `DocumentPickerResult`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Literal Type: `union`

Type representing successful and canceled document pick result.

Acceptable values are: [DocumentPickerSuccessResult](#documentpickersuccessresult) | [DocumentPickerCanceledResult](#documentpickercanceledresult)

### `DocumentPickerSuccessResult`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Type representing successful pick result.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| assets | [DocumentPickerAsset[]](#documentpickerasset) | An array of picked assets. |

# Expo

Set of common methods and types for Expo and related packages.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo
```

## API

```tsx
import * as Expo from 'expo';
```

### `expo/fetch` API

`expo/fetch` provides a [WinterCG-compliant Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.wintercg.org/) that works consistently across web and mobile environments, ensuring a standardized and cross-platform fetch experience within Expo applications.

```ts
import { fetch } from 'expo/fetch';

const resp = await fetch('https://httpbin.org/drip?numbytes=512&duration=2', {
  headers: { Accept: 'text/event-stream' },
});
const reader = resp.body.getReader();
const chunks = [];
while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) {
    break;
  }
  chunks.push(value);
}
const buffer = new Uint8Array(chunks.reduce((acc, chunk) => acc + chunk.length, 0));
console.log(buffer.length); // 512
```

### Encoding APIs

`TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` are built-in APIs that provide a way to encode and decode text in various character encodings. They are available on all platforms. Refer to the [browser and server runtime support](https://caniuse.com/textencoder) for web and Node.js.

```ts
// [104, 101, 108, 108, 111]
const hello = new TextEncoder().encode('hello');

// "hello"
const text = new TextDecoder().decode(hello);
```

The `TextEncoder` API is included in the Hermes engine. See the [source code in TextEncoder.cpp inside the Hermes GitHub repository](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/blob/9e2bbf8eda15936ee00aee4f8e024ceaa7cd800d/lib/VM/JSLib/TextEncoder.cpp#L1).

The `TextDecoder` API is not [spec-compliant](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#textdecoder) on native platforms. Only the UTF-8 encoding is supported. If you need support for more encodings, use a polyfill like [`text-encoding`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-encoding).

The stream equivalents of these APIs, `TextEncoderStream` and `TextDecoderStream`, are also available on all platforms. They allow you to encode and decode text in a streaming manner, which is useful for processing large amounts of data without loading it all into memory at once.

```ts
const encoder = new TextEncoderStream();
const stream = new ReadableStream({
  start(controller) {
    controller.enqueue('Hello');
    controller.enqueue('World');
    controller.close();
  },
});
const reader = stream.pipeThrough(encoder).getReader();
reader.read().then(({ done, value }) => {
  console.log(value); // Uint8Array [72, 101, 108, 108, 111]
});
```

### Streams API

Global support for standard web streams is available on native platforms to match the behavior of web and server platforms. Refer to the [browser and server runtime support](https://caniuse.com/streams) for specific web and Node.js support. EAS Hosting server runtime also includes support for the standard web streams API.

Globally access `ReadableStream`, `WritableStream`, and `TransformStream` classes.

```js
const stream = new ReadableStream({
  start(controller) {
    controller.enqueue('Hello');
    controller.enqueue('World');
    controller.close();
  },
});
const reader = stream.getReader();
reader.read().then(({ done, value }) => {
  console.log(value); // Hello
});
reader.read().then(({ done, value }) => {
  console.log(value); // World
});
```

### URL API

`URL` provides the standard API on all platforms.

On native platforms, built-in `URL` and `URLSearchParams` implementations replace the shims in `react-native`. Refer to the [browser and server runtime support](https://caniuse.com/url) for web and Node.js.

```ts
const url = new URL('https://expo.dev');

const params = new URLSearchParams();
```

Expo's built-in `URL` support attempts to be fully [spec compliant](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL). The only missing exception is that native platforms do not currently support [non-ASCII characters](https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/) in the hostname.

```ts
console.log(new URL('http://🥓').toString());

// This outputs the following:
// - Web, Node.js: http://xn--pr9h/
// - Android, iOS: http://🥓/
```

### `structuredClone`

`structuredClone` is a built-in function that allows you to create a deep copy of a value, including complex objects like `Map`, `Set`, and `ArrayBuffer`. It is available on all platforms.

```ts
const original = { name: 'Expo', date: new Date() };
const clone = structuredClone(original);
console.log(clone); // { name: 'Expo', date: Date }
```

The `transfer` option for `ArrayBuffer` and `TypedArray`s is not implemented.

Remove any custom polyfills for `structuredClone` to prevent bloat. Refer to the standard documentation for more information on the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/structuredClone).

## Constants

### `SharedRef`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: `SharedRef`

## Hooks

### `useEvent(eventEmitter, eventName, initialValue)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eventEmitter` | [EventEmitter](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/expo#eventemittertype)<TEventsMap\> | An object that emits events. For example, a native module or shared object or an instance of [`EventEmitter`](#eventemittertype). |
| `eventName` | `TEventName` | Name of the event to listen to. |
| `initialValue`(optional) | `TInitialValue | null` | An event parameter to use until the event is called for the first time. Default: `null` |

  

React hook that listens to events emitted by the given object. The returned value is an event parameter that gets updated whenever a new event is dispatched.

Returns: `InferEventParameter<teventlistener,>`

A parameter of the event listener.

Example

```tsx
import { useEvent } from 'expo';
import { VideoPlayer } from 'expo-video';

export function PlayerStatus({ videoPlayer }: { videoPlayer: VideoPlayer }) {
  const { status } = useEvent(videoPlayer, 'statusChange', { status: videoPlayer.status });

  return <Text>{`Player status: ${status}`}</Text>;
}
```

### `useEventListener(eventEmitter, eventName, listener)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eventEmitter` | [EventEmitter](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/expo#eventemittertype)<TEventsMap\> | An object that emits events. For example, a native module or shared object or an instance of [`EventEmitter`](#eventemittertype). |
| `eventName` | `TEventName` | Name of the event to listen to. |
| `listener` | `TEventListener` | A function to call when the event is dispatched. |

  

React hook that listens to events emitted by the given object and calls the listener function whenever a new event is dispatched. The event listener is automatically added during the first render and removed when the component unmounts.

Returns: `void`

Example

```tsx
import { useEventListener } from 'expo';
import { useVideoPlayer, VideoView } from 'expo-video';

export function VideoPlayerView() {
  const player = useVideoPlayer(videoSource);

  useEventListener(player, 'playingChange', ({ isPlaying }) => {
    console.log('Player is playing:', isPlaying);
  });

  return <VideoView player={player} />;

## Classes

### `EventEmitterType`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

A class that provides a consistent API for emitting and listening to events. It shares many concepts with other emitter APIs, such as Node's EventEmitter and `fbemitter`. When the event is emitted, all of the functions attached to that specific event are called _synchronously_. Any values returned by the called listeners are _ignored_ and discarded. Its implementation is written in C++ and common for all the platforms.

EventEmitterType Methods

### `addListener(eventName, listener)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `eventName` | `EventName` |
| `listener` | `TEventsMap[EventName]` |

  

Adds a listener for the given event name.

Returns: `EventSubscription`

### `emit(eventName, ...args)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `eventName` | `EventName` |
| `. .args` | `Parameters<TEventsMap[EventName]>` |

  

Synchronously calls all the listeners attached to that specific event. The event can include any number of arguments that will be passed to the listeners.

Returns: `void`

### `listenerCount(eventName)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `eventName` | `EventName` |

  

Returns a number of listeners added to the given event.

Returns: `number`

### `removeAllListeners(eventName)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `eventName` | `keyof TEventsMap` |

  

Removes all listeners for the given event name.

Returns: `void`

### `removeListener(eventName, listener)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `eventName` | `EventName` |
| `listener` | `TEventsMap[EventName]` |

  

Removes a listener for the given event name.

Returns: `void`

### `startObserving(eventName)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `eventName` | `EventName` |

  

Function that is automatically invoked when the first listener for an event with the given name is added. Override it in a subclass to perform some additional setup once the event started being observed.

Returns: `void`

### `stopObserving(eventName)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `eventName` | `EventName` |

  

Function that is automatically invoked when the last listener for an event with the given name is removed. Override it in a subclass to perform some additional cleanup once the event is no longer observed.

Returns: `void`

### `NativeModuleType`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: Class extends [EventEmitter](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/expo#eventemittertype)<TEventsMap\>

A class for all native modules. Extends the [`EventEmitter`](#eventemittertype) class.

### `SharedObjectType`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: Class extends [EventEmitter](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/expo#eventemittertype)<TEventsMap\> implements [EventEmitter](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/expo#eventemittertype)<TEventsMap\>

Base class for all shared objects that extends the [`EventEmitter`](#eventemittertype) class. The implementation is written in C++, installed through JSI and common for mobile platforms.

SharedObjectType Methods

### `release()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

A function that detaches the JS and native objects to let the native object deallocate before the JS object gets deallocated by the JS garbage collector. Any subsequent calls to native functions of the object will throw an error as it is no longer associated with its native counterpart.

In most cases, you should never need to use this function, except some specific performance-critical cases when manual memory management makes sense and the native object is known to exclusively retain some native memory (such as binary data or image bitmap). Before calling this function, you should ensure that nothing else will use this object later on. Shared objects created by React hooks are usually automatically released in the effect's cleanup phase, for example: `useVideoPlayer()` from `expo-video` and `useImage()` from `expo-image`.

Returns: `void`

### `SharedRefType`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: Class extends [SharedObject](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/expo#sharedobjecttype)<TEventsMap\> implements [SharedObject](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/expo#sharedobjecttype)<TEventsMap\>

A [`SharedObject`](#sharedobjecttype) that holds a reference to any native object. Allows passing references to native instances among different independent libraries.

For instance, `ImageRef` from `expo-image` references a [`Drawable`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/Drawable) on Android and an [`UIImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage) on iOS. Since both types are common on these platforms, different native modules can use them without depending on each other. In particular, this enables the `expo-image-manipulator` to pass the resulted image directly to the image view from `expo-image` without any additional writes and reads from the file system.

SharedRefType Properties

### `nativeRefType`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: `string`

The type of the native reference.

## Methods

### `installOnUIRuntime()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns: `void`

### `isRunningInExpoGo()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns a boolean value whether the app is running in Expo Go.

Returns: `boolean`

### `registerRootComponent(component)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `component` | `ComponentType<P>` | The React component class that renders the rest of your app. |

  

Sets the initial React component to render natively in the app's root React Native view on Android, iOS, tvOS and the web.

This method does the following:

-   Invokes React Native's `AppRegistry.registerComponent`.
-   Invokes React Native web's `AppRegistry.runApplication` on web to render to the root `index.html` file.
-   Polyfills the `process.nextTick` function globally.

This method also adds the following dev-only features that are removed in production bundles.

-   Adds the Fast Refresh and bundle splitting indicator to the app.
-   Asserts if the `expo-updates` package is misconfigured.
-   Asserts if `react-native` is not aliased to `react-native-web` when running in the browser.

Returns: `void`

> **See:** For information on how to setup `registerRootComponent` in an existing (bare) React Native app, see [Common questions](#rootregistercomponent-setup-for-existing-react-native-projects) below.

### `registerWebModule(moduleImplementation, moduleName)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `moduleImplementation` | `ModuleType` | A class that extends `NativeModule`. The class is registered under `globalThis.expo.modules[className]`. |
| `moduleName` | `string` | A name to register the module under `globalThis.expo.modules[className]`. |

  

Registers a web module.

Returns: `ModuleType`

Reloads the app. This method works for both release and debug builds.

Unlike [`Updates.reloadAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/updates#updatesreloadasync), this function does not use a new update even if one is available. It only reloads the app using the same JavaScript bundle that is currently running.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `requireNativeModule(moduleName)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `moduleName` | `string` | Name of the requested native module. |

  

Imports the native module registered with given name. In the first place it tries to load the module installed through the JSI host object and then falls back to the bridge proxy module. Notice that the modules loaded from the proxy may not support some features like synchronous functions.

Returns: `ModuleType`

Object representing the native module.

### `requireNativeView(moduleName, viewName)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |

| `eventEmitter` | [EventEmitter](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/expo#eventemittertype)<TEventsMap\> | An object that emits events. For example, a native module or shared object or an instance of [`EventEmitter`](#eventemittertype). |
| `eventName` | `TEventName` | Name of the event to listen to. |
| `listener` | `TEventListener` | A function to call when the event is dispatched. |

  

React hook that listens to events emitted by the given object and calls the listener function whenever a new event is dispatched. The event listener is automatically added during the first render and removed when the component unmounts.

Returns: `void`

Example

```tsx
import { useEventListener } from 'expo';
import { useVideoPlayer, VideoView } from 'expo-video';

export function VideoPlayerView() {
  const player = useVideoPlayer(videoSource);

  useEventListener(player, 'playingChange', ({ isPlaying }) => {
    console.log('Player is playing:', isPlaying);
  });

  return <VideoView player={player} />;

## Types

## Common questions

Some common questions about using the `expo` package in your project.

`rootRegisterComponent` setup for existing React Native projects

If you are managing your React Native project's native directories (**android** and **ios**) manually, you need to follow the instructions below to set up the `registerRootComponent` function. This is necessary for the Expo modules to work correctly.

**Android**

Update the **android/app/src/main/your-package/MainActivity.java** file to use the name `main` in the `getMainComponentName` function.

```diff
@Override
  protected String getMainComponentName() {
+    return "main";
  }
```

**iOS**

Update the iOS **ios/your-project/AppDelegate.(m|mm|swift)** file to use the **moduleName** `main` in the `createRootViewWithBridge:bridge moduleName:@"main" initialProperties:initProps` line of the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` function.

What if I want to name my main app file something other than App.js or app/_layout.tsx?

**For projects that do not use [Expo Router](/router/introduction)**, you can set the `"main"` in **package.json** to any file within your project. If you do this, then you need to use `registerRootComponent`. The `export default` will not make this component the root for the app if you are using a custom entry file.

For example, let's say you want to make **src/main.jsx** the entry file for your app — maybe you don't like having JavaScript files in the project root. First, set this in **package.json**:

```json
{
  "main": "src/main.jsx"
}
```

Then, in **src/main.jsx**, make sure you call `registerRootComponent` and pass in the component you want to render at the root of the app:

```jsx
import { registerRootComponent } from 'expo';
import { View } from 'react-native';

function App() {
  return <View />;
}

registerRootComponent(App);
```

**For projects that use [Expo Router](/router/introduction)**, you can create a custom entry point by following these steps from [Expo Router's installation guide](/router/installation#custom-entry-point-to-initialize-and-load). To use the top-level **src** directory in your Expo Router project, see [src directory reference](/router/reference/src-directory) for more information.

# Expo FileSystem (legacy)

A library that provides access to the local file system on the device.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Included in Expo Go

> The `legacy` version of the FileSystem API is included in the `expo-file-system` library. It can be used alongside the modern API for backward compatibility reasons.

`expo-file-system` provides access to a file system stored locally on the device. It is also capable of uploading and downloading files from network URLs.

Diagram explaining how expo-file-system interacts with different resources

How expo-file-system works differently inside of the Expo Go app

Within Expo Go, each project has a separate file system scope and has no access to the file system of other projects.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-file-system
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Downloading files

```js
const callback = downloadProgress => {
  const progress = downloadProgress.totalBytesWritten / downloadProgress.totalBytesExpectedToWrite;
  this.setState({
    downloadProgress: progress,
  });
};

const downloadResumable = FileSystem.createDownloadResumable(
  'http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.mp4',
  FileSystem.documentDirectory + 'small.mp4',
  {},
  callback
);

try {
  const { uri } = await downloadResumable.downloadAsync();
  console.log('Finished downloading to ', uri);
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}

try {
  await downloadResumable.pauseAsync();
  console.log('Paused download operation, saving for future retrieval');
  AsyncStorage.setItem('pausedDownload', JSON.stringify(downloadResumable.savable()));
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}

try {
  const { uri } = await downloadResumable.resumeAsync();
  console.log('Finished downloading to ', uri);
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}

//To resume a download across app restarts, assuming the DownloadResumable.savable() object was stored:
const downloadSnapshotJson = await AsyncStorage.getItem('pausedDownload');
const downloadSnapshot = JSON.parse(downloadSnapshotJson);
const downloadResumable = new FileSystem.DownloadResumable(
  downloadSnapshot.url,
  downloadSnapshot.fileUri,
  downloadSnapshot.options,
  callback,
  downloadSnapshot.resumeData
);

try {
  const { uri } = await downloadResumable.resumeAsync();
  console.log('Finished downloading to ', uri);
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}
```

### Managing Giphy's

```js
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system/legacy';

const gifDir = FileSystem.cacheDirectory + 'giphy/';
const gifFileUri = (gifId: string) => gifDir + `gif_${gifId}_200.gif`;
const gifUrl = (gifId: string) => `https://media1.giphy.com/media/${gifId}/200.gif`;

// Checks if gif directory exists. If not, creates it
async function ensureDirExists() {
  const dirInfo = await FileSystem.getInfoAsync(gifDir);
  if (!dirInfo.exists) {
    console.log("Gif directory doesn't exist, creating…");
    await FileSystem.makeDirectoryAsync(gifDir, { intermediates: true });
  }
}

// Downloads all gifs specified as array of IDs
export async function addMultipleGifs(gifIds: string[]) {
  try {
    await ensureDirExists();

    console.log('Downloading', gifIds.length, 'gif files…');
    await Promise.all(gifIds.map(id => FileSystem.downloadAsync(gifUrl(id), gifFileUri(id))));
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Couldn't download gif files:", e);
  }
}

// Returns URI to our local gif file
// If our gif doesn't exist locally, it downloads it
export async function getSingleGif(gifId: string) {
  await ensureDirExists();

  const fileUri = gifFileUri(gifId);
  const fileInfo = await FileSystem.getInfoAsync(fileUri);

  if (!fileInfo.exists) {
    console.log("Gif isn't cached locally. Downloading…");
    await FileSystem.downloadAsync(gifUrl(gifId), fileUri);
  }

  return fileUri;
}

// Exports shareable URI - it can be shared outside your app
export async function getGifContentUri(gifId: string) {
  return FileSystem.getContentUriAsync(await getSingleGif(gifId));
}

// Deletes whole giphy directory with all its content
export async function deleteAllGifs() {
  console.log('Deleting all GIF files…');
  await FileSystem.deleteAsync(gifDir);
}
```

### Server: handling multipart requests

The simple server in Node.js, which can save uploaded images to disk:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const fs = require('fs');
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

// This method will save the binary content of the request as a file.
app.patch('/binary-upload', (req, res) => {
  req.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./uploads/image' + Date.now() + '.png'));
  res.end('OK');
});

// This method will save a "photo" field from the request as a file.
app.patch('/multipart-upload', upload.single('photo'), (req, res) => {
  // You can access other HTTP parameters. They are located in the body object.
  console.log(req.body);
  res.end('OK');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Working on port 3000');
});
```

## API

```js
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system/legacy';
```

### Directories

The API takes `file://` URIs pointing to local files on the device to identify files. Each app only has read and write access to locations under the following directories:

-   [`FileSystem.documentDirectory`](/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem-legacy#documentdirectory)
-   [`FileSystem.cacheDirectory`](/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem-legacy#cachedirectory)

So, for example, the URI to a file named `'myFile'` under `'myDirectory'` in the app's user documents directory would be `FileSystem.documentDirectory + 'myDirectory/myFile'`.

Expo APIs that create files generally operate within these directories. This includes `Audio` recordings, `Camera` photos, `ImagePicker` results, `SQLite` databases and `takeSnapShotAsync()` results. This allows their use with the `FileSystem` API.

Some `FileSystem` functions are able to read from (but not write to) other locations.

### SAF URI

A SAF URI is a URI that is compatible with the Storage Access Framework. It should look like this `content://com.android.externalstorage.*`. The easiest way to obtain such URI is by [`requestDirectoryPermissionsAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem-legacy#requestdirectorypermissionsasyncinitialfileurl) method.

## Constants

### `FileSystem Legacy.bundleDirectory`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: `string | null`

URI to the directory where assets bundled with the application are stored.

### `FileSystem Legacy.cacheDirectory`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: `string | null`

`file://` URI pointing to the directory where temporary files used by this app will be stored. Files stored here may be automatically deleted by the system when low on storage. Example uses are for downloaded or generated files that the app just needs for one-time usage.

### `FileSystem Legacy.documentDirectory`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: `string | null`

`file://` URI pointing to the directory where user documents for this app will be stored. Files stored here will remain until explicitly deleted by the app. Ends with a trailing `/`. Example uses are for files the user saves that they expect to see again.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `FileSystem Legacy.createDownloadResumable(uri, fileUri, options, callback, resumeData)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uri` | `string` | The remote URI to download from. |
| `fileUri` | `string` | The local URI of the file to download to. If there is no file at this URI, a new one is created. If there is a file at this URI, its contents are replaced. The directory for the file must exist. |
| `options`(optional) | [DownloadOptions](#downloadoptions) | A map of download options represented by [`DownloadOptions`](#downloadoptions) type. |
| `callback`(optional) | `FileSystemNetworkTaskProgressCallback<DownloadProgressData>` | This function is called on each data write to update the download progress. Note: When the app has been moved to the background, this callback won't be fired until it's moved to the foreground. |
| `resumeData`(optional) | `string` | The string which allows the api to resume a paused download. This is set on the `DownloadResumable` object automatically when a download is paused. When initializing a new `DownloadResumable` this should be `null`. |

  

Create a `DownloadResumable` object which can start, pause, and resume a download of contents at a remote URI to a file in the app's file system.

> Note: You need to call `downloadAsync()`, on a `DownloadResumable` instance to initiate the download. The `DownloadResumable` object has a callback that provides download progress updates. Downloads can be resumed across app restarts by using `AsyncStorage` to store the `DownloadResumable.savable()` object for later retrieval. The `savable` object contains the arguments required to initialize a new `DownloadResumable` object to resume the download after an app restart. The directory for a local file uri must exist prior to calling this function.

Returns: `DownloadResumable`

### `StorageAccessFramework`

Supported platforms: Android.

The `StorageAccessFramework` is a namespace inside of the `expo-file-system` module, which encapsulates all functions which can be used with [SAF URIs](#saf-uri). You can read more about SAF in the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider).

Example

#### Basic Usage

```ts
import { StorageAccessFramework } from 'expo-file-system';

// Requests permissions for external directory
const permissions = await StorageAccessFramework.requestDirectoryPermissionsAsync();

if (permissions.granted) {
  // Gets SAF URI from response
  const uri = permissions.directoryUri;

  // Gets all files inside of selected directory
  const files = await StorageAccessFramework.readDirectoryAsync(uri);
  alert(`Files inside ${uri}:\n\n${JSON.stringify(files)}`);
}
```

#### Migrating an album

```ts
import * as MediaLibrary from 'expo-media-library';
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system/legacy';
const { StorageAccessFramework } = FileSystem;

async function migrateAlbum(albumName: string) {
  // Gets SAF URI to the album
  const albumUri = StorageAccessFramework.getUriForDirectoryInRoot(albumName);

  // Requests permissions
  const permissions = await StorageAccessFramework.requestDirectoryPermissionsAsync(albumUri);
  if (!permissions.granted) {
    return;
  }

  const permittedUri = permissions.directoryUri;
  // Checks if users selected the correct folder
  if (!permittedUri.includes(albumName)) {
    return;
  }

  const mediaLibraryPermissions = await MediaLibrary.requestPermissionsAsync();
  if (!mediaLibraryPermissions.granted) {
    return;
  }

  // Moves files from external storage to internal storage
  await StorageAccessFramework.moveAsync({
    from: permittedUri,
    to: FileSystem.documentDirectory!,
  });

  const outputDir = FileSystem.documentDirectory! + albumName;
  const migratedFiles = await FileSystem.readDirectoryAsync(outputDir);

  // Creates assets from local files
  const [newAlbumCreator, ...assets] = await Promise.all(
    migratedFiles.map<Promise<MediaLibrary.Asset>>(
      async fileName => await MediaLibrary.createAssetAsync(outputDir + '/' + fileName)
    )
  );

  // Album was empty
  if (!newAlbumCreator) {
    return;
  }

  // Creates a new album in the scoped directory
  const newAlbum = await MediaLibrary.createAlbumAsync(albumName, newAlbumCreator, false);
  if (assets.length) {
    await MediaLibrary.addAssetsToAlbumAsync(assets, newAlbum, false);
  }
}
```

## Enums

### `EncodingType`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

These values can be used to define how file system data is read / written.

#### `Base64`

`EncodingType.Base64 = "base64"`

Binary, radix-64 representation.

#### `UTF8`

`EncodingType.UTF8 = "utf8"`

Standard encoding format.

### `FileSystemSessionType`

Supported platforms: iOS.

These values can be used to define how sessions work on iOS.

#### `BACKGROUND`

`FileSystemSessionType.BACKGROUND = 0`

Using this mode means that the downloading/uploading session on the native side will work even if the application is moved to background. If the task completes while the application is in background, the Promise will be either resolved immediately or (if the application execution has already been stopped) once the app is moved to foreground again.

> Note: The background session doesn't fail if the server or your connection is down. Rather, it continues retrying until the task succeeds or is canceled manually.

#### `FOREGROUND`

`FileSystemSessionType.FOREGROUND = 1`

Using this mode means that downloading/uploading session on the native side will be terminated once the application becomes inactive (e.g. when it goes to background). Bringing the application to foreground again would trigger Promise rejection.

### `FileSystemUploadType`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

#### `BINARY_CONTENT`

`FileSystemUploadType.BINARY_CONTENT = 0`

The file will be sent as a request's body. The request can't contain additional data.

#### `MULTIPART`

`FileSystemUploadType.MULTIPART = 1`

An [RFC 2387-compliant](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2387.txt) request body. The provided file will be encoded into HTTP request. This request can contain additional data represented by [`UploadOptionsMultipart`](#uploadoptionsmultipart) type.

## Supported URI schemes

In this table, you can see what type of URI can be handled by each method. For example, if you have an URI, which begins with `content://`, you cannot use `FileSystem.readAsStringAsync()`, but you can use `FileSystem.copyAsync()` which supports this scheme.

| Method name | Android | iOS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getInfoAsync` | `file:///`,`content://`,`asset://`,no scheme | `file://`,`ph://`,`assets-library://` |
| `readAsStringAsync` | `file:///`,`asset://`,[SAF URI](/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem-legacy#saf-uri) | `file://` |
| `writeAsStringAsync` | `file:///`,[SAF URI](/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem-legacy#saf-uri) | `file://` |
| `deleteAsync` | `file:///`,[SAF URI](/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem-legacy#saf-uri) | `file://` |
| `moveAsync` | Source:`file:///`,[SAF URI](/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem-legacy#saf-uri)Destination:`file://` | Source:`file://`Destination:`file://` |
| `copyAsync` | Source:`file:///`,`content://`,`asset://`,[SAF URI](/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem-legacy#saf-uri),no schemeDestination:`file://` | Source:`file://`,`ph://`,`assets-library://`Destination:`file://` |
| `makeDirectoryAsync` | `file:///` | `file://` |
| `readDirectoryAsync` | `file:///` | `file://` |
| `downloadAsync` | Source:`http://`,`https://`Destination:`file:///` | Source:`http://`,`https://`Destination:`file://` |

# Expo FileSystem

A library that provides access to the local file system on the device.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Included in Expo Go

`expo-file-system` provides access to files and directories stored on a device or bundled as assets into the native project. It also allows downloading files from the network.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-file-system
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-file-system` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-file-system",
        {
          "supportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace": true,
          "enableFileSharing": true
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `supportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` | `false` | Only for: iOS. A boolean to enable `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` in **Info.plist**. This allows the app to open documents in place. |
| `enableFileSharing` | `false` | Only for: iOS. A boolean to enable `UIFileSharingEnabled` in **Info.plist**. This enables file sharing in the iOS Files app, making the app's Documents directory accessible to users through the Files app, iTunes File Sharing, and other file management tools. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using native **ios** project manually, then you need to add the `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` and `UIFileSharingEnabled` keys to your project's **ios/[app]/Info.plist**:

```xml
<key>LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace</key>
<true/>
<key>UIFileSharingEnabled</key>
<true/>
```

## Usage

```js
import { File, Directory, Paths } from 'expo-file-system';
```

The `File` and `Directory` instances hold a reference to a file, content, or asset URI.

The file or directory does not need to exist — an error will be thrown from the constructor only if the wrong class is used to represent an existing path (so if you try to create a `File` instance passing a path to an already existing directory).

## Features

-   Both synchronous and asynchronous, read and write access to file contents
-   Creation, modification and deletion
-   Available properties, such as `type`, `size`, `creationDate`, and more
-   Ability to read and write files as streams or using the `FileHandle` class
-   Easy file download/upload using `downloadFileAsync` or `expo/fetch`

## Examples

Writing and reading text files

```ts
import { File, Paths } from 'expo-file-system';

try {
  const file = new File(Paths.cache, 'example.txt');
  file.create(); // can throw an error if the file already exists or no permission to create it
  file.write('Hello, world!');
  console.log(file.textSync()); // Hello, world!
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```
Picking files using system pickers

Usage with `expo-document-picker`:

```ts
import { File } from 'expo-file-system';
import * as DocumentPicker from 'expo-document-picker';

try {
  const result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync({ copyToCacheDirectory: true });
  if (!result.canceled) {
    const { uri } = result.assets[0];
    const file = new File(uri);
    console.log(file.textSync());
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

Using the built-in `pickFileAsync` or `pickDirectoryAsync` method on Android:

```ts
import { File } from 'expo-file-system';

try {
  const file = new File.pickFileAsync();
  console.log(file.textSync());
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```
Downloading files

Using `downloadFileAsync`:

```ts
import { Directory, File, Paths } from 'expo-file-system';

const url = 'https://pdfobject.com/pdf/sample.pdf';
const destination = new Directory(Paths.cache, 'pdfs');
try {
  destination.create();
  const output = await File.downloadFileAsync(url, destination);
  console.log(output.exists); // true
  console.log(output.uri); // path to the downloaded file, e.g., '${cacheDirectory}/pdfs/sample.pdf'
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

Or using `expo/fetch`:

```ts
import { fetch } from 'expo/fetch';
import { File, Paths } from 'expo-file-system';

const url = 'https://pdfobject.com/pdf/sample.pdf';
const response = await fetch(url);
const src = new File(Paths.cache, 'file.pdf');
src.write(await response.bytes());
```
Uploading files using `expo/fetch`

You can upload files as blobs directly with `fetch` built into the Expo package:

```ts
import { fetch } from 'expo/fetch';
import { File, Paths } from 'expo-file-system';

const file = new File(Paths.cache, 'file.txt');
file.write('Hello, world!');

const response = await fetch('https://example.com', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: file,
});
```

Or using the `FormData` constructor:

```ts
import { fetch } from 'expo/fetch';
import { File, Paths } from 'expo-file-system';

const file = new File(Paths.cache, 'file.txt');
file.write('Hello, world!');
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('data', file);
const response = await fetch('https://example.com', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData,
});
```
Moving and copying files

```ts
import { Directory, File, Paths } from 'expo-file-system';
try {
  const file = new File(Paths.document, 'example.txt');
  file.create();
  console.log(file.uri); // '${documentDirectory}/example.txt'
  const copiedFile = new File(Paths.cache, 'example-copy.txt');
  file.copy(copiedFile);
  console.log(copiedFile.uri); // '${cacheDirectory}/example-copy.txt'
  file.move(Paths.cache);
  console.log(file.uri); // '${cacheDirectory}/example.txt'
  file.move(new Directory(Paths.cache, 'newFolder'));
  console.log(file.uri); // '${cacheDirectory}/newFolder/example.txt'
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```
Using legacy FileSystem API

```ts
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system/legacy';
import { File, Paths } from 'expo-file-system';

try {
  const file = new File(Paths.cache, 'example.txt');
  const content = await FileSystem.readAsStringAsync(file.uri);
  console.log(content);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```
Listing directory contents recursively

```ts
import { Directory, Paths } from 'expo-file-system';

function printDirectory(directory: Directory, indent: number = 0) {
  console.log(`${' '.repeat(indent)} + ${directory.name}`);
  const contents = directory.list();
  for (const item of contents) {
    if (item instanceof Directory) {
      printDirectory(item, indent + 2);
    } else {
      console.log(`${' '.repeat(indent + 2)} - ${item.name} (${item.size} bytes)`);
    }
  }
}

try {
  printDirectory(new Directory(Paths.cache));
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

`@expo/fingerprint` provides an API to generate a fingerprint (hash) of your project for use in determining compatibility between the native layer and JavaScript layer of your app. The hash calculation is configurable, but is by default derived from hashing app dependencies, custom native code, native project files, and configuration.

## Installation

`@expo/fingerprint` is included with [`expo`](/versions/latest/sdk/expo) and [`expo-updates`](/versions/latest/sdk/updates) by default.

If you wish to use `@expo/fingerprint` as a standalone package, you can install it by running the command:

```sh
npx expo install @expo/fingerprint
```

## CLI Usage

```sh
npx @expo/fingerprint --help
```

## Configuration

`@expo/fingerprint` provides defaults that should work for most projects, but also provides a few ways to configure the fingerprinting process to better fit your app structure and workflow.

### .fingerprintignore

Placed in your project root, **.fingerprintignore** is a [**.gitignore**](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format)-like ignore mechanism used to exclude files from hash calculation. All pattern paths are relative to the project root. It behaves similarly but instead uses `minimatch` for pattern matching which has some [limitations](/versions/latest/sdk/fingerprint#limitations) (see documentation for `ignorePaths` under [Options](/versions/latest/sdk/fingerprint#options)).

Here is an example **.fingerprintignore** configuration:

```ignore
# Ignore the entire android directory
android/**/*

# Ignore the entire ios directory but still keep ios/Podfile and ios/Podfile.lock
ios/**/*
!ios/Podfile
!ios/Podfile.lock

# Ignore specific package in node_modules
node_modules/some-package/**/*

# Same as above but having broader scope because packages may be nested
**/node_modules/some-package/**/*
```

### fingerprint.config.js

Placed in your project root, **fingerprint.config.js** allows you to specify custom hash calculation configuration beyond what is configurable in the **.fingerprintignore**. For supported configurations, see [Config](/versions/latest/sdk/fingerprint#config) and [`SourceSkips`](/versions/latest/sdk/fingerprint#sourceskips).

Below is an example **fingerprint.config.js** configuration, assuming you have `@expo/fingerprint` installed as a direct dependency:

```js
/** @type {import('@expo/fingerprint').Config} */
const config = {
  sourceSkips: [
    'ExpoConfigRuntimeVersionIfString',
    'ExpoConfigVersions',
    'PackageJsonAndroidAndIosScriptsIfNotContainRun',
  ],
};
module.exports = config;
```

If you are using `@expo/fingerprint` through `expo` (where `@expo/fingerprint` is installed as a transitive dependency), you can import fingerprint from `expo/fingerprint`:

```js
/** @type {import('expo/fingerprint').Config} */
```

Advanced: Customize sources before fingerprint hashing

In some cases, you may want to customize the sources before fingerprinting. For example:

-   You want to remove sensitive data from the app config.
-   You want to stabilize dynamic values in the app config.
-   You want to transform file hashes to stable values.

To do this, you can use the `fileHookTransform` option in the **fingerprint.config.js** file to transform the sources before hashing. Learn more about the [`fileHookTransform` option](/versions/latest/sdk/fingerprint#filehooktransformfunctionsource-chunk-isendoffile-encoding).

```js
const assert = require('node:assert');

const fileChunkMap = {};

/** @type {import('@expo/fingerprint').Config} */
const config = {
  fileHookTransform: (source, chunk, isEndOfFile, encoding) => {
    // Remove the "updates" section from the app config
    if (source.type === 'contents' && source.id === 'expoConfig') {
      assert(isEndOfFile, 'contents source is expected to have single chunk.');
      const config = JSON.parse(chunk);
      delete config.updates;
      return JSON.stringify(config);
    }

    // Transform content sources to an empty string
    if (source.type === 'contents' && source.id === 'packageJson:scripts') {
      return '';
    }

    // Transform a file source by replacing dynamic values
    if (source.type === 'file' && source.filePath === 'eas.json') {
      return chunk.toString().replace(/MyApp-Dev/g, 'MyApp');
    }

    // Transform a large file that is processed in multiple chunks
    // To get the full file, buffer all chunks and return them all at once
    if (source.type === 'file' && source.filePath === 'assets/large-image.jpg') {
      let receivedBuffer = fileChunkMap[source.filePath] ?? Buffer.alloc(0);
      if (chunk != null) {
        const buffer = typeof chunk === 'string' ? Buffer.from(chunk, encoding) : chunk;
        receivedBuffer = Buffer.concat([receivedBuffer, buffer]);
        fileChunkMap[source.filePath] = receivedBuffer;
      }
      if (!isEndOfFile) {
        return null;
      }
      fileChunkMap[source.filePath] = null;
      // The full payload is available here and you can transform it as needed.
      receivedBuffer = receivedBuffer.toString().replace(/SensitiveData/g, 'StableData');
      return receivedBuffer;
    }

    // For other sources, just return the chunk
    return chunk;
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

## Limitations

Limited support for `@expo/config-plugins` raw functions

When using config plugins with raw functions, it's essential to be aware of certain limitations, particularly in the context of fingerprinting. The library makes a best effort to generate fingerprints for changes made through config plugins; however, raw functions pose specific challenges. Raw functions are not serializable as fingerprints, which means they cannot be directly used for generating unique hashes.

To work around this limitation, the library employs one of the following strategies to create serializable fingerprints for raw functions:

1.  Using `Function.name`: The library utilizes the `Function.name` property if available for named raw functions. This property provides a recognizable name for the function, which can be used as a fingerprint property.
    
2.  Using `withAnonymous`: For anonymous raw functions without a `Function.name`, the library resorts to using `withAnonymous` as the fingerprint property. This is a generic identifier for anonymous functions.
    

Here's an example to illustrate a case in which the library will use [`withMyPlugin`, `withAnonymous`] as plugin properties for fingerprint hashing:

```js
const { withInfoPlist } = require('expo/config-plugins');

const withMyPlugin = (config) => {
  return withInfoPlist(config, (config) => {
    config.modResults.NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription = 'Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location';
    return config;
  });
};

export default ({ config }) => {
  config.plugins ||= [];
  config.plugins.push(withMyPlugin);
  config.plugins.push((config) => config);
  return config;
};
```

It's important to note that due to this design, if you make changes to the implementation of raw config plugins functions, such as altering the **Info.plist** value within `withMyPlugin`, the fingerprint will still generate the same hash value. To ensure unique fingerprints when modifying config plugins implementations, consider the following options:

-   Avoid Anonymous Functions: Avoid using anonymous raw config plugins functions. Instead, use named functions whenever possible, and ensure that their names remain consistent as long as the implementation changes.
    
-   Use Local config plugins: Alternatively, you can create local config plugins as separate modules, each with its own export. This approach allows you to specify a different function name when making changes to the config plugins implementations.
    

Here's an example of using a local config plugin:

```js
const { withInfoPlist } = require('expo/config-plugins');

const withMyPlugin = config => {
  return withInfoPlist(config, config => {
    config.modResults.NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription =
      'Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location';
    return config;
  });
};

module.exports = withMyPlugin;
```

```json
{
  "expo": {
    ... 
    "plugins": "./plugins/withMyPlugin"
  }
}
```

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage changes to config plugins and ensure that fingerprinting remains consistent and reliable.

### `SourceSkips`

Supported platforms: Node.

Bitmask of values that can be used to skip certain parts of the sourcers when generating a fingerprint.

#### `None`

`SourceSkips.None = 0`

Skip nothing

#### `ExpoConfigVersions`

`SourceSkips.ExpoConfigVersions = 1`

Versions in app.json, including Android versionCode and iOS buildNumber

#### `ExpoConfigRuntimeVersionIfString`

`SourceSkips.ExpoConfigRuntimeVersionIfString = 2`

runtimeVersion in app.json if it is a string

#### `ExpoConfigNames`

`SourceSkips.ExpoConfigNames = 4`

App names in app.json, including shortName and description

#### `ExpoConfigAndroidPackage`

`SourceSkips.ExpoConfigAndroidPackage = 8`

Android package name in app.json

#### `ExpoConfigIosBundleIdentifier`

`SourceSkips.ExpoConfigIosBundleIdentifier = 16`

iOS bundle identifier in app.json

# Expo Font

A library that allows loading fonts at runtime and using them in React Native components.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-font` allows loading fonts from the web and using them in React Native components. See more detailed usage information in the [Fonts](/develop/user-interface/fonts) guide.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-font
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

There are two ways to add fonts to your app: using the `expo-font` config plugin (recommended for Android and iOS) or loading them at runtime (which works across all platforms including web).

On Android and iOS, the plugin allows you to embed font files at build time which is more efficient than [`useFonts`](/versions/latest/sdk/font#usefonts) or [`loadAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/font#loadasyncfontfamilyorfontmap-source). After you set up the config plugin and run [prebuild](/workflow/continuous-native-generation#usage), you can render custom fonts right away. The plugin can be configured in different ways, see the [Fonts](/develop/user-interface/fonts#with-expo-font-config-plugin) guide on how to use it.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-font",
        {
          "fonts": ["./path/to/file.ttf"],
          "android": {
            "fonts": [
              {
                "fontFamily": "Source Serif 4",
                "fontDefinitions": [
                  {
                    "path": "./path/to/SourceSerif4-ExtraBold.ttf",
                    "weight": 800
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fonts` | `[]` | An array of font definitions to link to the native project. The paths should be relative to the project root. On Android, the file name becomes the font family name. On iOS, the font family name is always taken directly from the font file and may not be the same as the file name — follow the [naming advice](/develop/user-interface/fonts#how-to-determine-which-font-family-name-to-use) or use [`getLoadedFonts`](#getloadedfonts) to see what fonts are available. |
| `android` | `[]` | An array of font definitions to link to the native project on Android. Use the object syntax to embed [xml fonts](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/text-and-emoji/fonts-in-xml) with custom family name. |
| `ios` | `[]` | An array of font file paths to link to the native project on iOS. The font family name is taken directly from the font file. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

-   **Android:** Copy font files to **android/app/src/main/assets/fonts**.
-   **iOS**: See [Adding a Custom Font to Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/adding-a-custom-font-to-your-app) in the Apple Developer documentation.

## Usage

If you don't want to use the [config plugin](/versions/latest/sdk/font#configuration-in-app-config), you can load a font at runtime with the `useFonts` hook, as shown in the snippet:

```tsx
import { useFonts } from 'expo-font';
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();

export default function App() {
  // Use `useFonts` only if you can't use the config plugin.
  const [loaded, error] = useFonts({
    'Inter-Black': require('./assets/fonts/Inter-Black.otf'),
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (loaded || error) {
      SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    }
  }, [loaded, error]);

  if (!loaded && !error) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={{ fontFamily: 'Inter-Black', fontSize: 30 }}>Inter Black</Text>
      <Text style={{ fontSize: 30 }}>Platform Default</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});
```

```js
import * as Font from 'expo-font';
```

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: `UseFontHook`

Load a map of fonts at runtime with [`loadAsync`](#loadasyncfontfamilyorfontmap-source). This returns `true` if the fonts are loaded and ready to use. It also returns an error if something went wrong, to use in development.

> Note, the fonts are not "reloaded" when you dynamically change the font map.

Example

```tsx
const [loaded, error] = useFonts({
  'Inter-Black': require('./assets/fonts/Inter-Black.otf'),
});
```

## Methods

### `getLoadedFonts()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Synchronously get all the fonts that have been loaded. This includes fonts that were bundled at build time using the config plugin, as well as those loaded at runtime using `loadAsync`.

Returns: `string[]`

Returns array of strings which you can use as `fontFamily` [style prop](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text#style).

### `isLoaded(fontFamily)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fontFamily` | `string` | The name used to load the `FontResource`. |

  

Synchronously detect if the font for `fontFamily` has finished loading.

Returns: `boolean`

Returns `true` if the font has fully loaded.

### `isLoading(fontFamily)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fontFamily` | `string` | The name used to load the `FontResource`. |

  

Synchronously detect if the font for `fontFamily` is still being loaded.

Returns: `boolean`

Returns `true` if the font is still loading.

### `loadAsync(fontFamilyOrFontMap, source)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fontFamilyOrFontMap` | string | Record<string, [FontSource](#fontsource)\> | String or map of values that can be used as the `fontFamily` [style prop](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text#style) with React Native `Text` elements. |
| `source`(optional) | [FontSource](#fontsource) | The font asset that should be loaded into the `fontFamily` namespace. |

  

An efficient method for loading fonts from static or remote resources which can then be used with the platform's native text elements. In the browser, this generates a `@font-face` block in a shared style sheet for fonts. No CSS is needed to use this method.

> **Note**: We recommend using the [config plugin](#configuration-in-app-config) instead whenever possible.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

Returns a promise that fulfils when the font has loaded. Often you may want to wrap the method in a `try/catch/finally` to ensure the app continues if the font fails to load.

### `renderToImageAsync(glyphs, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `glyphs` | `string` | Text to be exported. |
| `options`(optional) | [RenderToImageOptions](#rendertoimageoptions) | RenderToImageOptions. |

  

Creates an image with provided text.

Returns: `Promise<rendertoimageresult>`

Promise which fulfils with image metadata.

## Interfaces

### `RenderToImageOptions`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| color(optional) | `string` | Font color. Default: `'black'` |
| fontFamily(optional) | `string` | Font family name. Default: `system default` |
| lineHeight(optional) | `number` | Line height of the text. Accepts number in dp units. |
| size(optional) | `number` | Size of the font. Default: `24` |

### `RenderToImageResult`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| height | `number` | Image height in dp. |
| scale | `number` | Scale factor of the image. Multiply the dp dimensions by this value to get the dimensions in pixels. |
| uri | `string` | The file uri to the image. |
| width | `number` | Image width in dp. |

## Types

### `FontResource`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

An object used to dictate the resource that is loaded into the provided font namespace when used with [`loadAsync`](#loadasyncfontfamilyorfontmap-source).

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| default(optional) | `string` | - |
| display(optional) | [FontDisplay](#fontdisplay) | Supported platforms: Web. Sets the [`font-display`](#fontdisplay) property for a given typeface in the browser. |
| testString(optional) | `string` | Supported platforms: Web. Sets a custom test string passed to the [FontFace Observer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fontfaceobserver). |
| uri(optional) | `string | number` | - |

### `FontSource`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Literal Type: `union`

The different types of assets you can provide to the [`loadAsync()`](#loadasyncfontfamilyorfontmap-source) function. A font source can be a URI, a module ID, or an Expo Asset.

Acceptable values are: `string` | `number` | [Asset](/versions/latest/sdk/asset#asset) | [FontResource](#fontresource)

## Enums

### `FontDisplay`

Supported platforms: Web.

Sets the [font-display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display) for a given typeface. The default font value on web is `FontDisplay.AUTO`. Even though setting the `fontDisplay` does nothing on native platforms, the default behavior emulates `FontDisplay.SWAP` on flagship devices like iOS, Samsung, Pixel, etc. Default functionality varies on One Plus devices. In the browser this value is set in the generated `@font-face` CSS block and not as a style property meaning you cannot dynamically change this value based on the element it's used in.

#### `AUTO`

`FontDisplay.AUTO = "auto"`

**(Default)** The font display strategy is defined by the user agent or platform. This generally defaults to the text being invisible until the font is loaded. Good for buttons or banners that require a specific treatment.

#### `BLOCK`

`FontDisplay.BLOCK = "block"`

The text will be invisible until the font has loaded. If the font fails to load then nothing will appear - it's best to turn this off when debugging missing text.

#### `FALLBACK`

`FontDisplay.FALLBACK = "fallback"`

Splits the behavior between `SWAP` and `BLOCK`. There will be a [100ms timeout](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/02/font-display?hl=en) where the text with a custom font is invisible, after that the text will either swap to the styled text or it'll show the unstyled text and continue to load the custom font. This is good for buttons that need a custom font but should also be quickly available to screen-readers.

#### `OPTIONAL`

`FontDisplay.OPTIONAL = "optional"`

This works almost identically to `FALLBACK`, the only difference is that the browser will decide to load the font based on slow connection speed or critical resource demand.

#### `SWAP`

`FontDisplay.SWAP = "swap"`

Fallback text is rendered immediately with a default font while the desired font is loaded. This is good for making the content appear to load instantly and is usually preferred.

## Error codes

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ERR_FONT_API | If the arguments passed to `loadAsync` are invalid. |
| ERR_FONT_SOURCE | The provided resource was of an incorrect type. |
| ERR_WEB_ENVIRONMENT | The browser's `document` element doesn't support injecting fonts. |
| ERR_DOWNLOAD | Failed to download the provided resource. |
| ERR_FONT_FAMILY | Invalid font family name was provided. |
| ERR_UNLOAD | Attempting to unload fonts that haven't finished loading yet. |

# Expo GLView

A library that provides GLView that acts as an OpenGL ES render target and provides GLContext. Useful for rendering 2D and 3D graphics.
Android, iOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-gl` provides a `View` that acts as an OpenGL ES render target, useful for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. On mounting, an OpenGL ES context is created. Its drawing buffer is presented as the contents of the `View` every frame.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-gl
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

```jsx
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { GLView } from 'expo-gl';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <GLView style={{ width: 300, height: 300 }} onContextCreate={onContextCreate} />
    </View>
  );
}

function onContextCreate(gl) {
  gl.viewport(0, 0, gl.drawingBufferWidth, gl.drawingBufferHeight);
  gl.clearColor(0, 1, 1, 1);

  // Create vertex shader (shape & position)
  const vert = gl.createShader(gl.VERTEX_SHADER);
  gl.shaderSource(
    vert,
    `
    void main(void) {
      gl_Position = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
      gl_PointSize = 150.0;
    }
  `
  );
  gl.compileShader(vert);

  // Create fragment shader (color)
  const frag = gl.createShader(gl.FRAGMENT_SHADER);
  gl.shaderSource(
    frag,
    `
    void main(void) {
      gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
    }
  `
  );
  gl.compileShader(frag);

  // Link together into a program
  const program = gl.createProgram();
  gl.attachShader(program, vert);
  gl.attachShader(program, frag);
  gl.linkProgram(program);
  gl.useProgram(program);

  gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
  gl.drawArrays(gl.POINTS, 0, 1);

  gl.flush();
  gl.endFrameEXP();
}
```

## High-level APIs

Since the WebGL API is quite low-level, it can be helpful to use higher-level graphics APIs rendering through a `GLView` underneath. The following libraries integrate popular graphics APIs:

-   [expo-three](https://github.com/expo/expo-three) for [three.js](https://threejs.org)
-   [expo-processing](https://github.com/expo/expo-processing) for [processing.js](http://processingjs.org)

Any WebGL-supporting library that expects a [WebGLRenderingContext](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/#5.14) could be used. Some times such libraries assume a web JavaScript context (such as assuming `document`). Usually this is for resource loading or event handling, with the main rendering logic still only using pure WebGL. So these libraries can usually still be used with a couple workarounds. The Expo-specific integrations above include workarounds for some popular libraries.

## Integration with Reanimated worklets

To use this API inside Reanimated worklet, you need to pass the GL context ID to the worklet and recreate the GL object like in the example below.

```jsx
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { runOnUI } from 'react-native-reanimated';
import { GLView } from 'expo-gl';

function render(gl) {
  'worklet';
  // add your WebGL code here
}

function onContextCreate(gl) {
  runOnUI((contextId: number) => {
    'worklet';
    const gl = GLView.getWorkletContext(contextId);
    render(gl);
  })(gl.contextId);
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <GLView
        style={{ width: 300, height: 300 }}
        enableExperimentalWorkletSupport
        onContextCreate={onContextCreate}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

For more in-depth example on how to use `expo-gl` with Reanimated and Gesture Handler you can check [this example](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/apps/native-component-list/src/screens/GL/GLReanimatedExample.tsx).

### Limitations

Worklet runtime is imposing some limitations on the code that runs inside it, so if you have existing WebGL code, it'll likely require some modifications to run inside a worklet thread.

-   Third-party libraries like Pixi.js or Three.js won't work inside the worklet, you can only use functions that have `'worklet'` added at the start.
-   If you need to load some assets to pass to the WebGL code, it needs to be done on the main thread and passed via some reference to the worklet. If you are using `expo-assets` you can just pass asset object returned by `Asset.fromModule` or from hook `useAssets` to the `runOnUI` function.
-   To implement a rendering loop you need to use `requestAnimationFrame`, APIs like `setTimeout` are not supported.

Check [Reanimated documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/guides/worklets/) to learn more.

## Remote debugging and GLView

This API does not function as intended with remote debugging enabled. The React Native debugger runs JavaScript on your computer, not the mobile device. GLView requires synchronous native calls that are not supported in Chrome.

## API

```js
import { GLView } from 'expo-gl';
```

## Component

### `GLView`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Type: React.[Component](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component)<[GLViewProps](#glviewprops)\>

A View that acts as an OpenGL ES render target. On mounting, an OpenGL ES context is created. Its drawing buffer is presented as the contents of the View every frame.

GLViewProps

### `enableExperimentalWorkletSupport`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Type: `boolean` • Default: `false`

Enables support for interacting with a `gl` object from code running on the Reanimated worklet thread.

### `msaaSamples`

Supported platforms: iOS.

Type: `number` • Default: `4`

`GLView` can enable iOS's built-in [multisampling](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/APPLE/APPLE_framebuffer_multisample.txt). This prop specifies the number of samples to use. Setting this to `0` turns off multisampling.

### `onContextCreate`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Type: (gl: [ExpoWebGLRenderingContext](#expowebglrenderingcontext)) => void

A function that will be called when the OpenGL ES context is created. The function is passed a single argument `gl` that extends a [WebGLRenderingContext](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/#5.14) interface.

#### Inherited Props

-   [ViewProps](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#props)

## Static Methods

### `createContextAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Imperative API that creates headless context which is devoid of underlying view. It's useful for headless rendering or in case you want to keep just one context per application and share it between multiple components. It is slightly faster than usual context as it doesn't swap framebuffers and doesn't present them on the canvas, however it may require you to take a snapshot in order to present its results. Also, keep in mind that you need to set up a viewport and create your own framebuffer and texture that you will be drawing to, before you take a snapshot.

Returns: `Promise<expowebglrenderingcontext>`

A promise that resolves to WebGL context object. See [WebGL API](#webgl-api) for more details.

### `destroyContextAsync(exgl)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exgl`(optional) | number | [ExpoWebGLRenderingContext](#expowebglrenderingcontext) | WebGL context to destroy. |

  

Destroys given context.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

A promise that resolves to boolean value that is `true` if given context existed and has been destroyed successfully.

### `takeSnapshotAsync(exgl, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exgl`(optional) | number | [ExpoWebGLRenderingContext](#expowebglrenderingcontext) | WebGL context to take a snapshot from. |

Takes a snapshot of the framebuffer and saves it as a file to app's cache directory.

Returns: `Promise<glsnapshot>`

A promise that resolves to `GLSnapshot` object.

## Component Methods

### `takeSnapshotAsync(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | [SnapshotOptions](#snapshotoptions) |

  

Same as static [`takeSnapshotAsync()`](#takesnapshotasyncoptions), but uses WebGL context that is associated with the view on which the method is called.

Returns: `Promise<glsnapshot>`

## Methods

Returns: `void`

### `_expo_texImage2D(...props)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `. .props` | `any[]` |

  

Returns: `void`

### `_expo_texSubImage2D(...props)`

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| compress(optional) | `number` | A value in range `0` to `1.0` specifying compression level of the result image. `1.0` means no compression and `0` the highest compression. Default: `1.0` |
| flip(optional) | `boolean` | Whether to flip the snapshot vertically. Default: `false` |
| format(optional) | `'jpeg' | 'png' | 'webp'` | Specifies what type of compression should be used and what is the result file extension. PNG compression is lossless but slower, JPEG is faster but the image has visible artifacts. Note: When using WebP format, the iOS version will print a warning, and generate a 'png' file instead. It is recommended to use platform-specific code in this case. Default: `'jpeg'` |
| framebuffer(optional) | [WebGLFramebuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLFramebuffer) | Specify the framebuffer that we will be reading from. Defaults to underlying framebuffer that is presented in the view or the current framebuffer if context is headless. |

## Enums

### `GLLoggingOption`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

#### `DISABLED`

`GLLoggingOption.DISABLED = 0`

Disables logging entirely.

#### `METHOD_CALLS`

`GLLoggingOption.METHOD_CALLS = 1`

Logs method calls, their parameters and results.

#### `GET_ERRORS`

`GLLoggingOption.GET_ERRORS = 2`

Calls `gl.getError()` after each other method call and prints an error if any is returned. This option has a significant impact on the performance as this method is blocking.

#### `RESOLVE_CONSTANTS`

`GLLoggingOption.RESOLVE_CONSTANTS = 4`

Resolves parameters of type `number` to their constant names.

#### `TRUNCATE_STRINGS`

`GLLoggingOption.TRUNCATE_STRINGS = 8`

When this option is enabled, long strings will be truncated. It's useful if your shaders are really big and logging them significantly reduces performance.

#### `ALL`

`GLLoggingOption.ALL = 15`

Enables all other options. It implies `GET_ERRORS` so be aware of the slowdown.

## WebGL API

Once the component is mounted and the OpenGL ES context has been created, the `gl` object received through the `onContextCreate` prop becomes the interface to the OpenGL ES context, providing a WebGL API. It resembles a [WebGL2RenderingContext](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/2.0/#3.7) in the WebGL 2 spec.

Some older Android devices may not support WebGL2 features. To check whether the device supports WebGL2 it's recommended to use `gl instanceof WebGL2RenderingContext`.

An additional method `gl.endFrameEXP()` is present, which notifies the context that the current frame is ready to present. This is similar to a 'swap buffers' API call in other OpenGL platforms.

The following WebGL2RenderingContext methods are currently unimplemented:

-   `getFramebufferAttachmentParameter()`
-   `getRenderbufferParameter()`
-   `compressedTexImage2D()`
-   `compressedTexSubImage2D()`
-   `getTexParameter()`
-   `getUniform()`
-   `getVertexAttrib()`
-   `getVertexAttribOffset()`
-   `getBufferSubData()`
-   `getInternalformatParameter()`
-   `renderbufferStorageMultisample()`
-   `compressedTexImage3D()`
-   `compressedTexSubImage3D()`
-   `fenceSync()`
-   `isSync()`
-   `deleteSync()`
-   `clientWaitSync()`
-   `waitSync()`
-   `getSyncParameter()`
-   `getActiveUniformBlockParameter()`

The `pixels` argument of [`texImage2D()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/texImage2D) must be `null`, an `ArrayBuffer` with pixel data, or an object of the form `{ localUri }` where `localUri` is the `file://` URI of an image in the device's file system. Thus, an `Asset` object is used once `.downloadAsync()` has been called on it (and completed) to fetch the resource.

For efficiency reasons, the current implementations of the methods don't perform type or bounds checking on their arguments. So, passing invalid arguments may cause a native crash. There are plans to update the API to perform argument checking in upcoming SDK versions.

Currently, the priority for error checking is low since engines generally don't rely on the OpenGL API to perform argument checking; otherwise, checks performed by the underlying OpenGL ES implementation are often sufficient.

# Expo GlassEffect

React components that render a liquid glass effect using iOS's native UIVisualEffectView.
iOS, tvOS, Included in Expo Go

> `GlassView` is only available on iOS 26 and above. It will fallback to regular `View` on unsupported platforms.

React components that render native iOS liquid glass effect using [`UIVisualEffectView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uivisualeffectview). Supports customizable glass styles and tint color.

#### Known issues

-   The `isInteractive` prop can only be set once on mount and cannot be changed dynamically after the component has been rendered. If you need to toggle interactive behavior, you must remount the component with a different `key`.
    
-   Setting `opacity` to `0` on `GlassView` or any of its parent views causes the glass effect to not render at all. To fade in/out the glass effect, use the built-in [`animate` and `animationDuration`](/versions/latest/sdk/glass-effect#animated-glass-effect-style) props in `glassEffectStyle` instead of changing opacity. If you still want to use `opacity`, see the [opacity animation workaround](/versions/latest/sdk/glass-effect#opacity-animation-workaround) example. For more details, see [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uivisualeffectview#Set-the-correct-alpha-value) and [GitHub issue #41024](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/41024).
    

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-glass-effect
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### `GlassView`

The `GlassView` component renders the native iOS glass effect. It supports different glass effect styles and can be customized with tint colors for various aesthetic needs.

```jsx
import { StyleSheet, View, Image } from 'react-native';
import { GlassView } from 'expo-glass-effect';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Image
        style={styles.backgroundImage}
        source={{
          uri: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506905925346-21bda4d32df4?w=400&h=400&fit=crop',
        }}
      />

      {/* Basic Glass View */}
      <GlassView style={styles.glassView} />

      {/* Glass View with clear style */}
      <GlassView style={styles.tintedGlassView} glassEffectStyle="clear" />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  backgroundImage: {
    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFill,
    width: '100%',
    height: '100%',
  },
  glassView: {
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 100,
    left: 50,
    width: 200,
    height: 100,
    borderRadius: 12,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  tintedGlassView: {
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 250,
    left: 50,
    width: 200,
    height: 100,
    borderRadius: 12,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 16,
    fontWeight: '600',
    color: '#000',
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
});
```

### `GlassContainer`

The `GlassContainer` component allows you to combine multiple glass views into a combined effect.

```jsx
import { StyleSheet, View, Image } from 'react-native';
import { GlassView, GlassContainer } from 'expo-glass-effect';

export default function GlassContainerDemo() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Image
        style={styles.backgroundImage}
        source={{
          uri: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1547036967-23d11aacaee0?w=400&h=600&fit=crop',
        }}
      />
      <GlassContainer spacing={10} style={styles.containerStyle}>
        <GlassView style={styles.glass1} isInteractive />
        <GlassView style={styles.glass2} />
        <GlassView style={styles.glass3} />
      </GlassContainer>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  backgroundImage: {
    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,
    width: '100%',
    height: '100%',
  },
  containerStyle: {
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 200,
    left: 50,
    width: 250,
    height: 100,
    flexDirection: 'row',
    alignItems: 'center',
    gap: 5,
  },
  glass1: {
    width: 60,
    height: 60,
    borderRadius: 30,
  },
  glass2: {
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
    borderRadius: 25,
  },
  glass3: {
    width: 40,
    height: 40,
    borderRadius: 20,
  },
});
```

### Animated glass effect style

The `glassEffectStyle` prop accepts a config object with `animate` and `animationDuration` properties to natively animate transitions between glass styles. This is the recommended way to fade in/out the glass effect without modifying `opacity`.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Image, Pressable } from 'react-native';
import { GlassView } from 'expo-glass-effect';

export default function AnimatedGlassStyleExample() {
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(true);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.backgroundImage}>
        <Image
          style={{
            width: 300,
            height: 200,
          }}
          source={{
            uri: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506905925346-21bda4d32df4?w=400&h=400&fit=crop',
          }}
        />
        <GlassView
          style={styles.glassView}
          glassEffectStyle={{
            style: visible ? 'clear' : 'none',
            animate: true,
            animationDuration: 0.5,
          }}
        />
      </View>
      <Pressable style={styles.toggleButton} onPress={() => setVisible(prev => !prev)}>
        <Text style={styles.toggleButtonText}>{visible ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} Glass Effect</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    height: 300,
    width: 300,
  },
  backgroundImage: {
    position: 'absolute',
  },
  glassView: {
    position: 'absolute',
    width: 200,
    height: 120,
    borderRadius: 12,
  },
  toggleButton: {
    position: 'absolute',
    bottom: 100,
    alignSelf: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#007AFF',
    paddingVertical: 14,
    paddingHorizontal: 24,
    borderRadius: 12,
  },
  toggleButtonText: {
    color: '#fff',
    fontSize: 16,
    fontWeight: '600',
  },
});
```

### Opacity animation workaround

Since setting `opacity` to `0` on `GlassView` or its parent views causes the glass effect to not render at all, you can use Reanimated to animate a wrapper view's opacity while toggling the `glassEffectStyle` between the desired style and `'none'`.

```jsx
import { GlassView } from 'expo-glass-effect';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Image, Pressable } from 'react-native';
import Animated, {
  useAnimatedProps,
  useAnimatedStyle,
  useSharedValue,
  withTiming,
} from 'react-native-reanimated';

const AnimatedGlassView = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(GlassView);

export default function GlassOpacityAnimationExample() {
  const fadeOpacity = useSharedValue(0);

  const glassViewProps = useAnimatedProps(() => {
    const glassEffectStyle = fadeOpacity.value > 0.01 ? 'regular' : 'none';
    return {
      glassEffectStyle,
      style: {
        width: 150,
        height: 100,
        borderRadius: 12,
        position: 'absolute',
      },
    };
  });

  const fadeOpacityStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
    position: 'absolute',
    opacity: fadeOpacity.value,
    width: 150,
    height: 100,
    borderRadius: 12,
  }));

  return (
    <>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Opacity Animation Workaround (iOS 26.1+)</Text>
      <View style={styles.backgroundContainer}>
        <Image
          style={styles.backgroundImage}
          source={{
            uri: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506905925346-21bda4d32df4?w=400&h=400&fit=crop',
          }}
        />
        <Animated.View style={fadeOpacityStyle}>
          <AnimatedGlassView animatedProps={glassViewProps} />
        </Animated.View>
      </View>

      <Pressable
        style={styles.toggleButton}
        onPress={() => {
          fadeOpacity.value = withTiming(fadeOpacity.value > 0.5 ? 0 : 1, { duration: 500 });
        }}>
        <Text style={styles.toggleButtonText}>Toggle Glass Visibility</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
  backgroundContainer: {
    height: 300,
    borderRadius: 12,
    overflow: 'hidden',
    position: 'relative',
  },
  backgroundImage: {
    width: '100%',
    height: '100%',
  },
  toggleButton: {
    backgroundColor: '#007AFF',
    paddingVertical: 14,
    paddingHorizontal: 24,
    borderRadius: 12,
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  toggleButtonText: {
    color: '#fff',
    fontSize: 16,
    fontWeight: '600',
  },
});
```

### `isLiquidGlassAvailable`

The `isLiquidGlassAvailable` function let's you check, if the Liquid Glass effect is available in the compiled application. It validates the system and compiler versions, as well as the [**Info.plist**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/UIDesignRequiresCompatibility) settings.

```tsx
import { isLiquidGlassAvailable } from 'expo-glass-effect';

export default function CheckLiquidGlass() {
  return (
    <Text>
      {isLiquidGlassAvailable()
        ? 'Liquid Glass effect is available'
        : 'Liquid Glass effect is not available'}
    </Text>
  );
}
```

### `isGlassEffectAPIAvailable`

The `isGlassEffectAPIAvailable` function checks whether the Liquid Glass API is available at runtime on the device.

> This API was added because some iOS 26 beta versions do not have the Liquid Glass API available, which can lead to crashes. You should check this before using `GlassView` in your app to ensure compatibility. See [GitHub issue #40911](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/40911) for more information.

```tsx
import { isGlassEffectAPIAvailable } from 'expo-glass-effect';

export default function CheckGlassEffectAPI() {
  return (
    <Text>
      {isGlassEffectAPIAvailable()
        ? 'Glass Effect API is available'
        : 'Glass Effect API is not available'}
    </Text>
  );
}
```

# Expo Gyroscope

A library that provides access to the device's gyroscope sensor.
Android, iOS (device only), Web, Included in Expo Go

`Gyroscope` from `expo-sensors` provides access to the device's gyroscope sensor to respond to changes in rotation in three-dimensional space.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-sensors
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, TouchableOpacity, View } from 'react-native';
import { Gyroscope } from 'expo-sensors';

export default function App() {
  const [{ x, y, z }, setData] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    z: 0,
  });
  const [subscription, setSubscription] = useState(null);

  const _slow = () => Gyroscope.setUpdateInterval(1000);
  const _fast = () => Gyroscope.setUpdateInterval(16);

  const _subscribe = () => {
    setSubscription(
      Gyroscope.addListener(gyroscopeData => {
        setData(gyroscopeData);
      })
    );
  };

  const _unsubscribe = () => {
    subscription && subscription.remove();
    setSubscription(null);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    _subscribe();
    return () => _unsubscribe();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Gyroscope:</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>x: {x}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>y: {y}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>z: {z}</Text>
      <View style={styles.buttonContainer}>
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={subscription ? _unsubscribe : _subscribe} style={styles.button}>
          <Text>{subscription ? 'On' : 'Off'}</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={_slow} style={[styles.button, styles.middleButton]}>
          <Text>Slow</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={_fast} style={styles.button}>
          <Text>Fast</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    paddingHorizontal: 10,
  },
  text: {
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
  buttonContainer: {
    flexDirection: 'row',
    alignItems: 'stretch',
    marginTop: 15,
  },
  button: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#eee',
    padding: 10,
  },
  middleButton: {
    borderLeftWidth: 1,
    borderRightWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ccc',
  },
});
```

## API

```js
import { Gyroscope } from 'expo-sensors';
```

## Classes

### `Gyroscope`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Type: Class extends [DeviceSensor](/versions/latest/sdk/sensors)<[GyroscopeMeasurement](#gyroscopemeasurement)\>

A base class for subscribable sensors. The events emitted by this class are measurements specified by the parameter type `Measurement`.

Gyroscope Methods

### `addListener(listener)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listener` | Listener<[GyroscopeMeasurement](#gyroscopemeasurement)\> | A callback that is invoked when a gyroscope update is available. When invoked, the listener is provided a single argument that is an `GyroscopeMeasurement` object. |

  

Subscribe for updates to the gyroscope.

Returns: `EventSubscription`

A subscription that you can call `remove()` on when you would like to unsubscribe the listener.

### `getListenerCount()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Returns the registered listeners count.

Returns: `number`

### `getPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Checks user's permissions for accessing sensor.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

### `hasListeners()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Returns boolean which signifies if sensor has any listeners registered.

Returns: `boolean`

### `isAvailableAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

> You should always check the sensor availability before attempting to use it.

Returns whether the gyroscope is enabled on the device.

On mobile web, you must first invoke `Gyroscope.requestPermissionsAsync()` in a user interaction (i.e. touch event) before you can use this module. If the `status` is not equal to `granted` then you should inform the end user that they may have to open settings.

On **web** this starts a timer and waits to see if an event is fired. This should predict if the iOS device has the **device orientation** API disabled in **Settings > Safari > Motion & Orientation Access**. Some devices will also not fire if the site isn't hosted with **HTTPS** as `DeviceMotion` is now considered a secure API. There is no formal API for detecting the status of `DeviceMotion` so this API can sometimes be unreliable on web.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

A promise that resolves to a `boolean` denoting the availability of the gyroscope.

### `removeAllListeners()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Removes all registered listeners.

Returns: `void`

> **Deprecated:** use subscription.remove() instead.

### `removeSubscription(subscription)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `subscription` | `EventSubscription` |

  

Returns: `void`

### `requestPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing sensor.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

### `setUpdateInterval(intervalMs)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intervalMs` | `number` | Desired interval in milliseconds between sensor updates. Starting from Android 12 (API level 31), the system has a 200Hz limit for each sensor updates. |

  

Set the sensor update interval.

Returns: `void`

## Interfaces

### `Subscription`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

A subscription object that allows to conveniently remove an event listener from the emitter.

Subscription Methods

### `remove()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Removes an event listener for which the subscription has been created. After calling this function, the listener will no longer receive any events from the emitter.

Returns: `void`

## Types

### `GyroscopeMeasurement`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Each of these keys represents the rotation along that particular axis measured in radians per second (rad/s).

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| timestamp | `number` | Timestamp of the measurement in seconds. |
| x | `number` | Value of rotation in radians per second device reported in X axis. |
| y | `number` | Value of rotation in radians per second device reported in Y axis. |
| z | `number` | Value of rotation in radians per second device reported in Z axis. |

### `PermissionExpiration`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

# Expo Haptics

A library that provides access to the system's vibration effects on Android, the haptics engine on iOS, and the Web Vibration API on web.
Android, iOS, Web

`expo-haptics` provides haptic (touch) feedback for:

-   Android devices using Vibrator system service.
-   iOS 10+ devices using the Taptic Engine.
-   Web platforms using the Web Vibration API.

On iOS, the Taptic engine will do nothing if any of the following conditions are true on a user's device:

-   Low Power Mode is enabled. This can be detected with [`expo-battery`](/versions/latest/sdk/battery).
-   User disabled the Taptic Engine in settings.
-   iOS Camera is active (to prevent destabilization).
-   iOS dictation is active (to not disturb the microphone input).

On web, the library uses the Web Vibration API. Note the following:

-   The API must be supported by the browser (check [browser compatibility](https://caniuse.com/vibration))
-   The device must have vibration hardware
-   The user must grant permission to use vibration (usually automatic)
-   Some browsers may ignore vibration in certain contexts (for example, background tabs)

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-haptics
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration

On Android, this library requires permission to control vibration on the device. The `VIBRATE` permission is added automatically.

## Usage

```jsx
import { StyleSheet, View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';
import * as Haptics from 'expo-haptics';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Haptics.selectionAsync</Text>
      <View style={styles.buttonContainer}>
        <Button title="Selection" onPress={() => Haptics.selectionAsync()} />
      </View>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Haptics.notificationAsync</Text>
      <View style={styles.buttonContainer}>
        <Button
          title="Success"
          onPress={
            () =>
              Haptics.notificationAsync(
                Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Success
              )
          }
        />
        <Button

                Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Warning
              )
          }
        />
      </View>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Haptics.impactAsync</Text>
      <View style={styles.buttonContainer}>
        <Button
          title="Light"
          onPress={
            () => Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light)
          }

## API

```js
import * as Haptics from 'expo-haptics';
```

## Methods

### `Haptics.impactAsync(style)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `style`(optional) | [ImpactFeedbackStyle](#impactfeedbackstyle) | A collision indicator that on Android is simulated using [`Vibrator`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Vibrator) and on iOS, it is directly mapped to [`UIImpactFeedbackStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimpactfeedbackgenerator/feedbackstyle). You can use one of `Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.{Light, Medium, Heavy, Rigid, Soft}`. Default: `ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium` |

  

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A `Promise` which fulfills once native size haptics functionality is triggered.

> **See:** Android's `Vibrator` API is not recommended for implementing haptics feedback. **Instead, you should use [`performAndroidHapticsAsync`](#hapticsperformandroidhapticsasynctype), which is similar to iOS haptic feedback and does not require `VIBRATE` permission.**

### `Haptics.notificationAsync(type)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type`(optional) | [NotificationFeedbackType](#notificationfeedbacktype) | A notification feedback type that on Android is simulated using [`Vibrator`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Vibrator) and iOS is directly mapped to [`UINotificationFeedbackType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinotificationfeedbacktype). You can use one of `Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.{Success, Warning, Error}`. Default: `NotificationFeedbackType.Success` |

  

The kind of notification response used in the feedback.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A `Promise` which fulfills once native size haptics functionality is triggered.

### `Haptics.performAndroidHapticsAsync(type)`

Supported platforms: Android.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | [AndroidHaptics](#androidhaptics) |

  

Use the device haptics engine to provide physical feedback to the user.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `Haptics.selectionAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Used to let a user know when a selection change has been registered.

# Expo Image

A cross-platform and performant React component that loads and renders images.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-image` is a cross-platform React component that loads and renders images.

**Main features:**

-   Designed for speed
-   Support for many image formats (including animated ones)
-   Disk and memory caching
-   Supports [BlurHash](https://blurha.sh) and [ThumbHash](https://evanw.github.io/thumbhash/) - compact representations of a placeholder for an image
-   Transitioning between images when the source changes (no more flickering!)
-   Implements the CSS [`object-fit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) and [`object-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) properties (see [`contentFit`](/versions/latest/sdk/image#contentfit) and [`contentPosition`](/versions/latest/sdk/image#contentposition) props)
-   Uses performant [`SDWebImage`](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage) and [`Glide`](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) under the hood

#### Supported image formats

| Format | Android | iOS | Web |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WebP | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| PNG / APNG | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| AVIF | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| HEIC | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ [not adopted yet](https://caniuse.com/heif) |

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-image
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure build-time settings for `expo-image` using its [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction). Add the plugin to the `plugins` array in your **app.json** or **app.config.js** and rebuild the native project.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-image",
        {
          "disableLibdav1d": true
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `disableLibdav1d` | `false` | Only for: iOS. When `true`, skips adding the bundled `libavif/libdav1d` Pod. Use this when another dependency (such as `FFmpegKit`) already links `libdav1d`. Disabling the Pod removes AVIF image support on iOS unless another decoder is available. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you are not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using native **ios** project manually, then set the shell environment variable `EXPO_IMAGE_DISABLE_LIBDAV1D=1` before running `pod install` to achieve the same effect. Alternatively, you can add `ENV['EXPO_IMAGE_DISABLE_LIBDAV1D'] ||= '0'` to the top of your `Podfile`.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Image } from 'expo-image';
import { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';

const blurhash =
  '|rF?hV%2WCj[ayj[a|j[az_NaeWBj@ayfRayfQfQM{M|azj[azf6fQfQfQIpWXofj[ayj[j[fQayWCoeoeaya}j[ayfQa{oLj?j[WVj[ayayj[fQoff7azayj[ayj[j[ayofayayayj[fQj[ayayj[ayfjj[j[ayjuayj[';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Image
        style={styles.image}
        source="https://picsum.photos/seed/696/3000/2000"
        placeholder={{ blurhash }}
        contentFit="cover"
        transition={1000}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  image: {
    flex: 1,
    width: '100%',
    backgroundColor: '#0553',
  },
});
```

## API

```js
import { Image } from 'expo-image';
```

## Components

### `Image`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: React.[PureComponent](https://react.dev/reference/react/PureComponent)<[ImageProps](#imageprops)\>

Some props are from React Native Image that Expo Image supports (more or less) for easier migration, but all of them are deprecated and might be removed in the future.

ImageProps

### `accessibilityLabel`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `string` • Default: `undefined`

The text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the image. Sets the `alt` tag on web which is used for web crawlers and link traversal.

### `accessible`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `false`

When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element. When a view is an accessibility element, it groups its children into a single selectable component.

On Android, the `accessible` property will be translated into the native `isScreenReaderFocusable`, so it's only affecting the screen readers behaviour.

### `allowDownscaling`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `true`

Whether the image should be downscaled to match the size of the view container. Turning off this functionality could negatively impact the application's performance, particularly when working with large assets. However, it would result in smoother image resizing, and end-users would always have access to the highest possible asset quality.

Downscaling is never used when the `contentFit` prop is set to `none` or `fill`.

### `alt`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `string` • Default: `undefined`

The text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the image. Sets the `alt` tag on web which is used for web crawlers and link traversal. Is an alias for `accessibilityLabel`.

### `autoplay`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `true`

Determines if an image should automatically begin playing if it is an animated image.

### `blurRadius`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `number` • Default: `0`

The radius of the blur in points, `0` means no blur effect. This effect is not applied to placeholders.

### `cachePolicy`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Literal type: `union` • Default: `'disk'`

Determines whether to cache the image and where: on the disk, in the memory or both.

-   `'none'` - Image is not cached at all.
    
-   `'disk'` - Image is queried from the disk cache if exists, otherwise it's downloaded and then stored on the disk.
    
-   `'memory'` - Image is cached in memory. Might be useful when you render a high-resolution picture many times. Memory cache may be purged very quickly to prevent high memory usage and the risk of out of memory exceptions.
    
-   `'memory-disk'` - Image is cached in memory, but with a fallback to the disk cache.
    

Acceptable values are: `'none'` | `'disk'` | `'memory'` | `'memory-disk'` | `null`

### `contentFit`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `ImageContentFit` • Default: `'cover'`

Determines how the image should be resized to fit its container. This property tells the image to fill the container in a variety of ways; such as "preserve that aspect ratio" or "stretch up and take up as much space as possible". It mirrors the CSS [`object-fit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) property.

-   `'cover'` - The image is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the container box. If the image's aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of its box, then the object will be clipped to fit.
    
-   `'contain'` - The image is scaled down or up to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the container box.
    
-   `'fill'` - The image is sized to entirely fill the container box. If necessary, the image will be stretched or squished to fit.
    
-   `'none'` - The image is not resized and is centered by default. When specified, the exact position can be controlled with [`contentPosition`](#contentposition) prop.
    
-   `'scale-down'` - The image is sized as if `none` or `contain` were specified, whichever would result in a smaller concrete image size.
    

### `contentPosition`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: [ImageContentPosition](#imagecontentposition) • Default: `'center'`

It is used together with [`contentFit`](#contentfit) to specify how the image should be positioned with x/y coordinates inside its own container. An equivalent of the CSS [`object-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) property.

### `decodeFormat`

Supported platforms: Android.

Optional • Type: `ImageDecodeFormat` • Default: `'argb'`

The format in which the image data should be decoded. It's not guaranteed that the platform will use the specified format.

-   `'argb'` - The image is decoded into a 32-bit color space with alpha channel ([https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.Config#ARGB_8888](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.Config#ARGB_8888)).
    
-   `'rgb'` - The image is decoded into a 16-bit color space without alpha channel ([https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.Config#RGB_565](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.Config#RGB_565)).
    

> **Deprecated:** Provides compatibility for [`defaultSource` from React Native Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image#defaultsource). Use [`placeholder`](#placeholder) prop instead.

### `defaultSource`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Literal type: `union`

Acceptable values are: [ImageSource](#imagesource) | `null`

### `draggable`

Supported platforms: Web.

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `undefined`

Whether the `img` element is draggable on web.

### `enableLiveTextInteraction`

Supported platforms: iOS 16.0+.

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `false`

Enables Live Text interaction with the image. Check official [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionkit/enabling_live_text_interactions_with_images) for more details.

### `enforceEarlyResizing`

Supported platforms: iOS.

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `false`

Force early resizing of the image to match the container size. This option helps to reduce the memory usage of the image view, especially when the image is larger than the container. It may affect the `resizeType` and `contentPosition` properties when the image view is resized dynamically.

> **Deprecated:** Provides compatibility for [`fadeDuration` from React Native Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image#fadeduration-android). Instead use [`transition`](#transition) with the provided duration.

### `fadeDuration`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `number`

### `focusable`

Supported platforms: Android.

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `false`

Whether this View should be focusable with a non-touch input device and receive focus with a hardware keyboard.

### `loading`

Supported platforms: Web.

Optional • Literal type: `string` • Default: `'eager'`

Sets the HTML [`loading`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#loading) attribute on the `<img>` element. Has no effect on native platforms.

-   `'lazy'` - Defers loading until the image is near the viewport.
-   `'eager'` - Loads the image immediately.

Acceptable values are: `'lazy'` | `'eager'`

> **Deprecated:** Provides compatibility for [`loadingIndicatorSource` from React Native Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image#loadingindicatorsource). Use [`placeholder`](#placeholder) prop instead.

### `loadingIndicatorSource`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Literal type: `union`

Acceptable values are: [ImageSource](#imagesource) | `null`

### `onDisplay`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `() => void`

Called when the image view successfully rendered the source image.

### `onError`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: (event: [ImageErrorEventData](#imageerroreventdata)) => void

Called on an image fetching error.

### `onLoad`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: (event: [ImageLoadEventData](#imageloadeventdata)) => void

Called when the image load completes successfully.

### `onLoadEnd`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `() => void`

Called when the image load either succeeds or fails.

### `onLoadStart`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `() => void`

Called when the image starts to load.

### `onProgress`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: (event: [ImageProgressEventData](#imageprogresseventdata)) => void

Called when the image is loading. Can be called multiple times before the image has finished loading. The event object provides details on how many bytes were loaded so far and what's the expected total size.

### `placeholder`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Literal type: `union`

An image to display while loading the proper image and no image has been displayed yet or the source is unset.

> **Note**: The default value for placeholder's content fit is 'scale-down', which differs from the source image's default value. Using a lower-resolution placeholder may cause flickering due to scaling differences between it and the final image. To prevent this, you can set the [`placeholderContentFit`](#placeholdercontentfit) to match the [`contentFit`](#contentfit) value.

Acceptable values are: `string` | `number` | [ImageSource](#imagesource) | [SharedRef](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/expo#sharedreftype)<'image', Record<never, never\>\> | [ImageSource[]](#imagesource) | `string[]` | `null`

### `placeholderContentFit`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `ImageContentFit` • Default: `'scale-down'`

Determines how the placeholder should be resized to fit its container. Available resize modes are the same as for the [`contentFit`](#contentfit) prop.

### `preferHighDynamicRange`

Supported platforms: iOS 17.0+, tvOS 17.0+.

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `false`

Controls whether the image view can leverage the extended dynamic range (EDR). Use this prop if you want to support high dynamic range (HDR) images, otherwise all images are rendered as standard dynamic range (SDR).

### `priority`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Literal type: `union` • Default: `'normal'`

Priorities for completing loads. If more than one load is queued at a time, the load with the higher priority will be started first. Priorities are considered best effort, there are no guarantees about the order in which loads will start or finish.

Acceptable values are: `'normal'` | `'low'` | `'high'` | `null`

### `recyclingKey`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Optional • Literal type: `union` • Default: `null`

Changing this prop resets the image view content to blank or a placeholder before loading and rendering the final image. This is especially useful for any kinds of recycling views like [FlashList](https://github.com/shopify/flash-list) to prevent showing the previous source before the new one fully loads.

Acceptable values are: `string` | `null`

> **Deprecated:** Provides compatibility for [`resizeMode` from React Native Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image#resizemode). Note that `"repeat"` option is not supported at all. Use the more powerful [`contentFit`](#contentfit) and [`contentPosition`](#contentposition) props instead.

### `resizeMode`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Literal type: `string`

Acceptable values are: `'cover'` | `'contain'` | `'repeat'` | `'center'` | `'stretch'`

### `responsivePolicy`

Supported platforms: Web.

Optional • Literal type: `string` • Default: `'static'`

Controls the selection of the image source based on the container or viewport size on the web.

If set to `'static'`, the browser selects the correct source based on user's viewport width. Works with static rendering. Make sure to set the `'webMaxViewportWidth'` property on each source for best results. For example, if an image occupies 1/3 of the screen width, set the `'webMaxViewportWidth'` to 3x the image width. The source with the largest `'webMaxViewportWidth'` is used even for larger viewports.

If set to `'initial'`, the component will select the correct source during mount based on container size. Does not work with static rendering.

If set to `'live'`, the component will select the correct source on every resize based on container size. Does not work with static rendering.

Acceptable values are: `'live'` | `'initial'` | `'static'`

### `sfEffect`

Supported platforms: iOS 17.0+.

Optional • Literal type: `union`

SF Symbol effect animations. Can be a single effect string, an effect object, or an array of effect strings and/or objects.

Example

```tsx
// Single effect as string
sfEffect="bounce"

// Single effect as object with options
sfEffect={{ effect: "bounce", repeat: -1, scope: "by-layer" }}

// Array of mixed strings and objects
sfEffect={["bounce", { effect: "pulse", repeat: -1 }]}
```

Acceptable values are: [SFSymbolEffect](#sfsymboleffect) | `null`

### `source`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Literal type: `union`

The image source, either a remote URL, a local file resource or a number that is the result of the `require()` function. When provided as an array of sources, the source that fits best into the container size and is closest to the screen scale will be chosen. In this case it is important to provide `width`, `height` and `scale` properties.

For SF Symbols (iOS), use the `sf:` prefix followed by the symbol name, for example, `sf:star.fill`.

> **Note**: For the complete list of SF Symbols, see [Apple's SF Symbols catalog](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) or the [`sf-symbols-typescript`](https://github.com/nandorojo/sf-symbols-typescript) library documentation.

Acceptable values are: `number` | [ImageSource](#imagesource) | `string & undefined` | [SharedRef](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/expo#sharedreftype)<'image', Record<never, never\>\> | [ImageSource[]](#imagesource) | `string[]` | `sf:<symbol>`

### `tintColor`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Literal type: `union` • Default: `null`

A color used to tint template images (a bitmap image where only the opacity matters). The color is applied to every non-transparent pixel, causing the image's shape to adopt that color. This effect is not applied to placeholders.

Acceptable values are: `string` | `null`

### `transition`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Literal type: `union`

Describes how the image view should transition the contents when switching the image source.  
If provided as a number, it is the duration in milliseconds of the `'cross-dissolve'` effect.

Acceptable values are: `number` | [ImageTransition](#imagetransition) | `null`

### `useAppleWebpCodec`

Supported platforms: iOS.

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `true`

Whether to use the Apple's default WebP codec.

Set this prop to `false` to use the official standard-compliant [libwebp](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp) codec for WebP images. The default implementation from Apple is faster and uses less memory but may render animated images with incorrect blending or play them at the wrong framerate.

An object that is a reference to a native image instance – [Drawable](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/Drawable) on Android and [UIImage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage) on iOS. Instances of this class can be passed as a source to the [Image](#image) component in which case the image is rendered immediately since its native representation is already available in the memory.

ImageRef Properties

### `height`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Read Only • Type: `number`

Logical height of the image. Multiply it by the value in the `scale` property to get the height in pixels.

### `isAnimated`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Read Only • Type: `boolean`

Whether the referenced image is an animated image.

### `mediaType`

Supported platforms: iOS.

Read Only • Literal type: `union`

Media type (also known as MIME type) of the image, based on its format. Returns `null` when the format is unknown or not supported.

Acceptable values are: `string` | `null`

### `nativeRefType`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: `string`

The type of the native reference.

### `scale`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Read Only • Type: `number`

On iOS, if you load an image from a file whose name includes the `@2x` modifier, the scale is set to **2.0**. All other images are assumed to have a scale factor of **1.0**. On Android, it calculates the scale based on the bitmap density divided by screen density.

On all platforms, if you multiply the logical size of the image by this value, you get the dimensions of the image in pixels.

### `width`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Read Only • Type: `number`

Logical width of the image. Multiply it by the value in the `scale` property to get the width in pixels.

## Types

### `ImageCacheConfig`

Supported platforms: iOS.

An object containing options for the [`configureCache`](#configurecacheconfig) function. See [`SDImageCacheConfig`](https://sdwebimage.github.io/documentation/sdwebimage/sdimagecacheconfig) for more information.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| maxDiskSize(optional) | `number` | The maximum size of the disk cache, in bytes. Defaults to 0, which means there is no cache size limit. |
| maxMemoryCost(optional) | `number` | The maximum "total cost" of the in-memory image cache. The cost function is the bytes size held in memory, not simply the pixel count. For example, a typical ARGB8888 image uses 4 bytes (32 bits) per pixel. Defaults to 0, which means there is no memory cost limit. |
| maxMemoryCount(optional) | `number` | The maximum number of objects the in-memory image cache should hold. Defaults to 0, which means there is no memory count limit. |

### `ImageContentPosition`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Specifies the position of the image inside its container. One value controls the x-axis and the second value controls the y-axis.

Additionally, it supports stringified shorthand form that specifies the edges to which to align the image content:  
`'center'`, `'top'`, `'right'`, `'bottom'`, `'left'`, `'top center'`, `'top right'`, `'top left'`, `'right center'`, `'right top'`, `'right bottom'`, `'bottom center'`, `'bottom right'`, `'bottom left'`, `'left center'`, `'left top'`, `'left bottom'`.  
If only one keyword is provided, then the other dimension is set to `'center'` (`'50%'`), so the image is placed in the middle of the specified edge.  
As an example, `'top right'` is the same as `{ top: 0, right: 0 }` and `'bottom'` is the same as `{ bottom: 0, left: '50%' }`.

Type: `ImageContentPositionString` or `object` shaped as below:

### `ImageContentPositionValue`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Literal Type: `union`

A value that represents the relative position of a single axis.

If `number`, it is a distance in points (logical pixels) from the respective edge.  
If `string`, it must be a percentage value where `'100%'` is the difference in size between the container and the image along the respective axis, or `'center'` which is an alias for `'50%'` that is the default value. You can read more regarding percentages on the MDN docs for [`background-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position#regarding_percentages) that describes this concept well.

## Generating a blurhash on a server

Images can significantly improve the visual experience, however, they can also slow down app/page loading times due to their large file sizes. To overcome this, you can create placeholder images using blurhash algorithm that provides an immersive experience while deferring the loading of the actual picture until later.

This guide demonstrates how to create a blurhash of an uploaded image on the backend using JavaScript and Express.js. The same techniques and principles apply to other languages and server technologies.

Start by installing a few dependencies: [`multer`](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) for handling multipart requests, [`sharp`](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) for converting files to a data buffer, and the official [`blurhash` JavaScript package](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash/tree/master/TypeScript).

```sh
npm install multer sharp blurhash
```

Next, import all required functions from installed packages and initialize `multer`:

```js
// Multer is a middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`.
const multer = require('multer');
// Sharp allows you to receive a data buffer from the uploaded image.
const sharp = require('sharp');
// Import the encode function from the blurhash package.
const { encode } = require('blurhash');

// Initialize `multer`.
const upload = multer();
```

Assuming the `app` is a variable that holds a reference to the Express server, an endpoint can be created that accepts an image and returns a JSON response containing the generated blurhash.

```js
app.post('/blurhash', upload.single('image'), async (req, res) => {
  const { file } = req;
  // If the file is not available we're returning with error.
  if (file === null) {
    res.status(400).json({ message: 'Image is missing' });
    return;
  }

  // Users can specify number of components in each axes.
  const componentX = req.body.componentX ?? 4;
  const componentY = req.body.componentY ?? 3;

  // We're converting provided image to a byte buffer.
  // Sharp currently supports multiple common formats like JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, and AVIF.
  const { data, info } = await sharp(file.buffer).ensureAlpha().raw().toBuffer({
    resolveWithObject: true,
  });

  const blurhash = encode(
    new Uint8ClampedArray(data),
    info.width,
    info.height,
    componentX,
    componentY
  );
  res.json({ blurhash });
});
```

Additionally, the request can include two parameters: `componentX` and `componentY`, are passed through the algorithm. These values can be calculated or hard-coded on the server or specified by the user. However, they must be within the range of 1 to 9 and have an aspect ratio similar to the uploaded image. A value of 9 will give the best results but may take longer to generate the hash.

The process of generating a blurhash can be accomplished in various languages and server technologies, similar to the one using JavaScript. The key step is to locate an encoder for your chosen language, which can often be found in the [`woltapp/blurhash`](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash#implementations) repository. Once you have the encoder, you will need to obtain a representation of the image. Some libraries use a default image class (for example, the Swift implementation uses `UIImage`). In other cases, you will have to provide raw byte data. Make sure to check the encoder's documentation to confirm the expected data format.

> When working with raw byte data, ensure that the alpha layer is present (each pixel is represented by red, green, blue, and alpha values). Failing to do so will lead to errors such as "width and height must match the pixels array".

# Expo ImageManipulator

A library that provides an API for image manipulation on the local file system.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-image-manipulator` provides an API to modify images stored on the local file system.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-image-manipulator
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

This will first rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise, then flip the rotated image vertically and save it as a PNG.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Button, Image, StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { Asset } from 'expo-asset';
import { FlipType, SaveFormat, useImageManipulator } from 'expo-image-manipulator';

const IMAGE = Asset.fromModule(require('./assets/snack-icon.png'));

export default function App() {
  const [imageUri, setImageUri] = useState(IMAGE.uri);
  const [isReady, setIsReady] = useState(false);
  const context = useImageManipulator(imageUri);

  const loadImageAsync = async () => {
    await IMAGE.downloadAsync();
    setImageUri(IMAGE.localUri ?? IMAGE.uri);
    setIsReady(true);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    loadImageAsync();
  }, []);

  const rotate90andFlip = async () => {
    context.rotate(90).flip(FlipType.Vertical);
    const renderedImage = await context.renderAsync();
    const result = await renderedImage.saveAsync({
      format: SaveFormat.PNG,
    });

    setImageUri(result.uri);
  };

  if (!isReady) {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text>Loading image...</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.imageContainer}>
        <Image source={{ uri: imageUri }} style={styles.image} />
      </View>
      <Button title="Rotate and Flip" onPress={rotate90andFlip} />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  imageContainer: {
    marginVertical: 20,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',

# Expo ImagePicker

A library that provides access to the system's UI for selecting images and videos from the phone's library or taking a photo with the camera.
Android, iOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-image-picker` provides access to the system's UI for selecting images and videos from the phone's library or taking a photo with the camera.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-image-picker
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

#### Known issues 

On iOS, when an image (usually of a [higher resolution](http://www.openradar.me/49866214)) is picked from the camera roll, the result of the cropped image gives the wrong value for the cropped rectangle in some cases. Unfortunately, this issue is with the underlying `UIImagePickerController` due to a bug in the closed-source tools built into iOS.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-image-picker` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

By default `expo-image-picker` will add `RECORD_AUDIO` permission on Android. You can remove it by setting the `microphonePermission` to false in the config below.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-image-picker",
        {
          "photosPermission": "The app accesses your photos to let you share them with your friends."
          "colors": {
            "cropToolbarColor": "#000000",
          },
          "dark": {
            "colors": {
              "cropToolbarColor": "#000000",
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `photosPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your photos"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` permission message. |
| `cameraPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera"` | A string to set the `NSCameraUsageDescription` permission message. If value `false` is provided then `CAMERA` permission will be blocked on Android. |
| `microphonePermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone"` | A string to set the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` permission message. If value `false` is provided then `RECORD_AUDIO` permission will be blocked on Android. |
| `colors` | `undefined` | Only for: Android. An object containing color properties for customizing the image picker crop UI in light mode. |
| `colors.cropToolbarColor` | `#00000000` | Only for: Android. A hex color string for the crop toolbar background color. |
| `colors.cropToolbarIconColor` | `#ffffff` | Only for: Android. A hex color string for the crop toolbar icon color. |
| `colors.cropToolbarActionTextColor` | `#ffffff` | Only for: Android. A hex color string for the crop toolbar action text color. |
| `colors.cropBackButtonIconColor` | `#ffffff` | Only for: Android. A hex color string for the crop toolbar back button icon color. |
| `colors.cropBackgroundColor` | `#ffffff` | Only for: Android. A hex color string for the crop screen background color. |
| `dark.colors` | `{ cropToolbarColor: "#00000000", cropToolbarIconColor: "#ffffff", cropToolbarActionTextColor: "#ffffff", cropBackButtonIconColor: "#ffffff", cropBackgroundColor: "#000000" }` | Only for: Android. An object containing color properties for customizing the image picker crop UI in dark mode. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using a native **ios** project manually, then you need to add `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`, `NSCameraUsageDescription`, and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` keys to your **ios/[app]/Info.plist**:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to save photos</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to access your camera</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to use your microphone</string>
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Alert, Button, Image, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';

export default function ImagePickerExample() {
  const [image, setImage] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const pickImage = async () => {
    // No permissions request is necessary for launching the image library.
    // Manually request permissions for videos on iOS when `allowsEditing` is set to `false`
    // and `videoExportPreset` is `'Passthrough'` (the default), ideally before launching the picker
    // so the app users aren't surprised by a system dialog after picking a video.
    // See "Invoke permissions for videos" sub section for more details.
    const permissionResult = await ImagePicker.requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync();

    if (!permissionResult.granted) {
      Alert.alert('Permission required', 'Permission to access the media library is required.');
      return;
    }

    let result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
      mediaTypes: ['images', 'videos'],
      allowsEditing: true,
      aspect: [4, 3],
      quality: 1,
    });

    console.log(result);

    if (!result.canceled) {
      setImage(result.assets[0].uri);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Pick an image from camera roll" onPress={pickImage} />
      {image && <Image source={{ uri: image }} style={styles.image} />}
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  image: {
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
  },
});
```

When you run this example and pick an image, you will see the image that you picked show up in your app, and a similar log will be shown in the console:

```json
{
  "assets": [
    {
      "assetId": "C166F9F5-B5FE-4501-9531",
      "base64": null,
      "duration": null,
      "exif": null,
      "fileName": "IMG.HEIC",
      "fileSize": 6018901,
      "height": 3025,
      "type": "image",
      "uri": "file:///data/user/0/host.exp.exponent/cache/cropped1814158652.jpg"
      "width": 3024
    }
  ],
  "canceled": false
}
```

### Invoke permissions for videos

In SDK 54 and later, the default configuration keeps `allowsEditing` set to `false` and [`videoExportPreset`](/versions/latest/sdk/imagepicker#videoexportpreset) set to `'Passthrough'`. These settings return the original asset (including HEIC and AVIF files) instantly because the picker skips compression, but iOS requires media library permission to access the original file and displays a permission dialog immediately after the user selects a video.

To avoid showing permissions dialog after selection, **manually request media library permissions before opening the picker** via [`requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/imagepicker#imagepickerrequestmedialibrarypermissionsasyncwriteonly) or [`useMediaLibraryPermissions`](/versions/latest/sdk/imagepicker#usemedialibrarypermissionsoptions).

## API

```js
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';
```

## Hooks

### `useCameraPermissions(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | `PermissionHookOptions<object>` |

  

Check or request permissions to access the camera. This uses both `requestCameraPermissionsAsync` and `getCameraPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns: `[PermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<permissionresponse>, GetPermissionMethod]</permissionresponse>`

Example

```ts
const [status, requestPermission] = ImagePicker.useCameraPermissions();
```

### `useMediaLibraryPermissions(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | `PermissionHookOptions<{ writeOnly: boolean }>` |

  

Check or request permissions to access the media library. This uses both `requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync` and `getMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns: `[MediaLibraryPermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<medialibrarypermissionresponse>, GetPermissionMethod]</medialibrarypermissionresponse>`

Example

```ts
const [status, requestPermission] = ImagePicker.useMediaLibraryPermissions();
```

## Methods

### `ImagePicker.getCameraPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Checks user's permissions for accessing camera.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type [CameraPermissionResponse](#camerapermissionresponse).

### `ImagePicker.getMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync(writeOnly)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `writeOnly`(optional) | `boolean` | Whether to request write or read and write permissions. Defaults to `false`. Default: `false` |

  

Checks user's permissions for accessing photos.

Returns: `Promise<medialibrarypermissionresponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type [MediaLibraryPermissionResponse](#medialibrarypermissionresponse).

### `ImagePicker.getPendingResultAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Android system sometimes kills the `MainActivity` after the `ImagePicker` finishes. When this happens, we lose the data selected using the `ImagePicker`. However, you can retrieve the lost data by calling `getPendingResultAsync`. You can test this functionality by turning on `Don't keep activities` in the developer options.

Returns: `Promise<imagepickererrorresult>`

-   **On Android:** a promise that resolves to an object of exactly same type as in `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync` or `ImagePicker.launchCameraAsync` if the `ImagePicker` finished successfully. Otherwise, an object of type [`ImagePickerErrorResult`](#imagepickerimagepickererrorresult).
-   **On other platforms:** `null`

### `ImagePicker.launchCameraAsync(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | [ImagePickerOptions](#imagepickeroptions) | An `ImagePickerOptions` object. Default: `{}` |

  

Display the system UI for taking a photo with the camera. Requires `Permissions.CAMERA`. On Android and iOS 10 `Permissions.CAMERA_ROLL` is also required. On mobile web, this must be called immediately in a user interaction like a button press, otherwise the browser will block the request without a warning.

> **Note:** Make sure that you handle `MainActivity` destruction on **Android**. See [ImagePicker.getPendingResultAsync](#imagepickergetpendingresultasync). **Notes for Web:** The system UI can only be shown after user activation (e.g. a `Button` press). Therefore, calling `launchCameraAsync` in `componentDidMount`, for example, will **not** work as intended. The `cancelled` event will not be returned in the browser due to platform restrictions and inconsistencies across browsers.

Returns: `Promise<imagepickerresult>`

A promise that resolves to an object with `canceled` and `assets` fields. When the user canceled the action the `assets` is always `null`, otherwise it's an array of the selected media assets which have a form of [`ImagePickerAsset`](#imagepickerasset).

### `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | [ImagePickerOptions](#imagepickeroptions) | An object extended by [`ImagePickerOptions`](#imagepickeroptions). Default: `{}` |

  

Display the system UI for choosing an image or a video from the phone's library. Requires `Permissions.MEDIA_LIBRARY` on iOS 10 only. On mobile web, this must be called immediately in a user interaction like a button press, otherwise the browser will block the request without a warning.

**Animated GIFs support:** On Android, if the selected image is an animated GIF, the result image will be an animated GIF too if and only if `quality` is explicitly set to `1.0` and `allowsEditing` is set to `false`. Otherwise compression and/or cropper will pick the first frame of the GIF and return it as the result (on Android the result will be a PNG). On iOS, both quality and cropping are supported.

> **Notes for Web:** The system UI can only be shown after user activation (e.g. a `Button` press). Therefore, calling `launchImageLibraryAsync` in `componentDidMount`, for example, will **not** work as intended. The `cancelled` event will not be returned in the browser due to platform restrictions and inconsistencies across browsers.

Returns: `Promise<imagepickerresult>`

A promise that resolves to an object with `canceled` and `assets` fields. When the user canceled the action the `assets` is always `null`, otherwise it's an array of the selected media assets which have a form of [`ImagePickerAsset`](#imagepickerasset).

### `ImagePicker.requestCameraPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing camera. This does nothing on web because the browser camera is not used.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type [CameraPermissionResponse](#camerarollpermissionresponse).

### `ImagePicker.requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync(writeOnly)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `writeOnly`(optional) | `boolean` | Whether to request write or read and write permissions. Defaults to `false`. Default: `false` |

  

Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing user's photo. This method does nothing on web.

Returns: `Promise<medialibrarypermissionresponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type [MediaLibraryPermissionResponse](#medialibrarypermissionresponse).

| allowsMultipleSelection(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: Android, iOS 14+, Web. Whether or not to allow selecting multiple media files at once. Cropping multiple images is not supported - this option is mutually exclusive with allowsEditing. If this option is enabled, then allowsEditing is ignored. Default: `false` |
| aspect(optional) | `[number, number]` | An array with two entries `[x, y]` specifying the aspect ratio to maintain if the user is allowed to edit the image (by passing `allowsEditing: true`). This is only applicable on Android, since on iOS the crop rectangle is always a square. |
| base64(optional) | `boolean` | Whether to also include the image data in Base64 format. |
| cameraType(optional) | [CameraType](#cameratype) | Selects the camera-facing type. The `CameraType` enum provides two options: `front` for the front-facing camera and `back` for the back-facing camera.
-   **On Android**, the behavior of this option may vary based on the camera app installed on the device.
-   **On Web**, if this option is not provided, use "camera" as the default value of internal input element for backwards compatibility.

. Default: `CameraType.back` |
| defaultTab(optional) | [DefaultTab](#defaulttab) | Supported platforms: Android. Choose the default tab with which the image picker will be opened. Default: `'photos'` |

| selectionLimit(optional) | `number` | Supported platforms: Android, iOS 14+. The maximum number of items that user can select. Applicable when `allowsMultipleSelection` is enabled. Setting the value to `0` sets the selection limit to the maximum that the system supports. Default: `0` |
| shape(optional) | [CropShape](#cropshape) | Supported platforms: Android. Specify the shape of the crop area if the user is allowed to edit the image (by passing `allowsEditing: true`). This option is only applicable on Android. Default: `rectangle` |
| shouldDownloadFromNetwork(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: iOS. When enabled, allows the picker to access and download media from iCloud or other remote sources if the asset is not stored locally on the device. For videos, this option applies only when [`videoExportPreset`](#videoexportpreset) is set to `Passthrough`. In all other cases, the video will be downloaded from iCloud automatically. Default: `false` |
| videoExportPreset(optional) | [VideoExportPreset](#videoexportpreset) | Deprecated: See videoExportPreset in Apple documentation. . Supported platforms: iOS 11+. Specify preset which will be used to compress selected video. Default: `ImagePicker.VideoExportPreset.Passthrough` |

# Expo KeepAwake

A React component that prevents the screen from sleeping when rendered.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-keep-awake` provides a React hook that prevents the screen from sleeping and a pair of functions to enable this behavior imperatively.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-keep-awake
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Example: hook

```jsx
import { useKeepAwake } from 'expo-keep-awake';
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function KeepAwakeExample() {
  useKeepAwake();
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      <Text>This screen will never sleep!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Example: functions

```jsx
import { activateKeepAwake, deactivateKeepAwake } from 'expo-keep-awake';
import React from 'react';
import { Button, View } from 'react-native';

export default class KeepAwakeExample extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <Button onPress={this._activate} title="Activate" />
        <Button onPress={this._deactivate} title="Deactivate" />
      </View>
    );
  }

  _activate = () => {
    activateKeepAwake();
    alert('Activated!');
  };

  _deactivate = () => {
    deactivateKeepAwake();
    alert('Deactivated!');
  };
}
```

## API

```js
import * as KeepAwake from 'expo-keep-awake';
```

## Constants

### `KeepAwake.ExpoKeepAwakeTag`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: `'ExpoKeepAwakeDefaultTag'`

Default tag, used when no tag has been specified in keep awake method calls.

## Hooks

### `useKeepAwake(tag, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tag`(optional) | `string` | Tag to lock screen sleep prevention. If not provided, an ID unique to the owner component is used. |
| `options`(optional) | [KeepAwakeOptions](#keepawakeoptions) | Additional options for the keep awake hook. |

  

A React hook to keep the screen awake for as long as the owner component is mounted. The optionally provided `tag` argument is used when activating and deactivating the keep-awake feature. If unspecified, an ID unique to the owner component is used. See the documentation for `activateKeepAwakeAsync` below to learn more about the `tag` argument.

Returns: `void`

## Methods

> **Deprecated:** use `activateKeepAwakeAsync` instead.

### `KeepAwake.activateKeepAwake(tag)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tag`(optional) | `string` | Tag to lock screen sleep prevention. If not provided, the default tag is used. Default: `ExpoKeepAwakeTag` |

  

Prevents the screen from sleeping until `deactivateKeepAwake` is called with the same `tag` value.

If the `tag` argument is specified, the screen will not sleep until you call `deactivateKeepAwake` with the same `tag` argument. When using multiple `tags` for activation you'll have to deactivate each one in order to re-enable screen sleep. If tag is unspecified, the default `tag` is used.

Web support [is limited](https://caniuse.com/wake-lock).

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `KeepAwake.activateKeepAwakeAsync(tag)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tag`(optional) | `string` | Tag to lock screen sleep prevention. If not provided, the default tag is used. Default: `ExpoKeepAwakeTag` |

  

Prevents the screen from sleeping until `deactivateKeepAwake` is called with the same `tag` value.

If the `tag` argument is specified, the screen will not sleep until you call `deactivateKeepAwake` with the same `tag` argument. When using multiple `tags` for activation you'll have to deactivate each one in order to re-enable screen sleep. If tag is unspecified, the default `tag` is used.

Web support [is limited](https://caniuse.com/wake-lock).

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `KeepAwake.deactivateKeepAwake(tag)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |

| `tag`(optional) | `string` | Tag to release the lock on screen sleep prevention. If not provided, the default tag is used. Default: `ExpoKeepAwakeTag` |

  

Releases the lock on screen-sleep prevention associated with the given `tag` value. If `tag` is unspecified, it defaults to the same default tag that `activateKeepAwake` uses.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `KeepAwake.isAvailableAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

`true` on all platforms except [unsupported web browsers](https://caniuse.com/wake-lock).

## Event Subscriptions

### `KeepAwake.addListener(tagOrListener, listener)`

Supported platforms: Web.

| Parameter | Type |

| `listener`(optional) | [KeepAwakeListener](/versions/latest/sdk/keep-awake#keepawakelistenerevent) |

  

Observe changes to the keep awake timer. On web, this changes when navigating away from the active window/tab. No-op on native.

Returns: `EventSubscription`

Example

```ts
KeepAwake.addListener(({ state }) => {
  // ...
});
```

## Types

### `KeepAwakeEvent`

# Expo LinearGradient

A universal React component that renders a gradient view.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-linear-gradient` provides a native React view that transitions between multiple colors in a linear direction.

> React Native also provides `experimental_backgroundImage` (Android and iOS) and `backgroundImage` (Web) style properties on `View` component that support CSS gradient syntax such as [`linear-gradient()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/gradient/linear-gradient) and [`radial-gradient()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/gradient/radial-gradient). This can be an alternative for gradient backgrounds without adding an extra dependency. Since this is an experimental property, if you encounter any issues, please [report them to the React Native repository](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-linear-gradient
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

```tsx
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { LinearGradient } from 'expo-linear-gradient';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <LinearGradient
        // Background Linear Gradient
        colors={['rgba(0,0,0,0.8)', 'transparent']}
        style={styles.background}
      />
      <LinearGradient
        // Button Linear Gradient
        colors={['#4c669f', '#3b5998', '#192f6a']}
        style={styles.button}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Sign in with Facebook</Text>
      </LinearGradient>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: 'orange',
  },
  background: {
    position: 'absolute',
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    top: 0,
    height: 300,
  },
  button: {
    padding: 15,
    alignItems: 'center',
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
  text: {
    backgroundColor: 'transparent',
    fontSize: 15,
    color: '#fff',
  },
});
```

## API

```js
import { LinearGradient } from 'expo-linear-gradient';
```

## Component

### `LinearGradient`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: React.[Component](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component)<[LinearGradientProps](#lineargradientprops)\>

Renders a native view that transitions between multiple colors in a linear direction.

LinearGradientProps

### `colors`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: readonly \[[ColorValue](https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors), [ColorValue](https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors), ...[ColorValue[]](https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors)\]

A readonly array of colors that represent stops in the gradient. At least two colors are required (for a single-color background, use the `style.backgroundColor` prop on a `View` component).

For TypeScript to know the provided array has 2 or more values, it should be provided "inline" or typed `as const`.

### `dither`

Supported platforms: Android.

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `true`

Enables or disables paint dithering. Dithering can reduce the gradient color banding issue. Setting `false` may improve gradient rendering performance.

### `end`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Literal type: `union`

For example, `{ x: 0.1, y: 0.2 }` means that the gradient will end `10%` from the left and `20%` from the bottom.

**On web**, this only changes the angle of the gradient because CSS gradients don't support changing the end position.

Acceptable values are: [LinearGradientPoint](#lineargradientpoint) | `null`

### `locations`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Literal type: `union` • Default: `[]`

A readonly array that contains `number`s ranging from `0` to `1`, inclusive, and is the same length as the `colors` property. Each number indicates a color-stop location where each respective color should be located. If not specified, the colors will be distributed evenly across the gradient.

For example, `[0.5, 0.8]` would render:

-   the first color, solid, from the beginning of the gradient view to 50% through (the middle);
-   a gradient from the first color to the second from the 50% point to the 80% point; and
-   the second color, solid, from the 80% point to the end of the gradient view.

> The color-stop locations must be ascending from least to greatest.

Acceptable values are: `readonly [number, number, ...number[]]` | `null`

### `start`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Literal type: `union`

For example, `{ x: 0.1, y: 0.2 }` means that the gradient will start `10%` from the left and `20%` from the top.

**On web**, this only changes the angle of the gradient because CSS gradients don't support changing the starting position.

Acceptable values are: [LinearGradientPoint](#lineargradientpoint) | `null`

#### Inherited Props

-   [ViewProps](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#props)

## Types

### `LinearGradientPoint`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

An object `{ x: number; y: number }` or array `[x, y]` that represents the point at which the gradient starts or ends, as a fraction of the overall size of the gradient ranging from `0` to `1`, inclusive.

Type: [NativeLinearGradientPoint](#nativelineargradientpoint) or `object` shaped as below:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | `number` | A number ranging from `0` to `1`, representing the position of gradient transformation. |
| y | `number` | A number ranging from `0` to `1`, representing the position of gradient transformation. |

### `NativeLinearGradientPoint`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Tuple: `[x: number, y: number]`

# Expo Linking

An API that provides methods to create and open deep links universally.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-linking` provides utilities for your app to interact with other installed apps using deep links. It also provides helper methods for constructing and parsing deep links into your app. This library is an extension of the React Native [`Linking`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking).

For a more comprehensive explanation of how to use `expo-linking`, refer to the [Linking into other apps](/linking/into-other-apps).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-linking
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## API

```js
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';
```

## Hooks

### `useLinkingURL()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns the linking URL followed by any subsequent changes to the URL. Always returns the initial URL immediately on reload.

Returns: `string | null`

Returns the initial URL or `null`.

> **Deprecated:** Use `useLinkingURL` hook instead.

### `useURL()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns the initial URL followed by any subsequent changes to the URL.

Returns: `string | null`

Returns the initial URL or `null`.

## Methods

### `Linking.canOpenURL(url)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | `string` | The URL that you want to test can be opened. |

  

Determine whether or not an installed app can handle a given URL. On web this always returns `true` because there is no API for detecting what URLs can be opened.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

A `Promise` object that is fulfilled with `true` if the URL can be handled, otherwise it `false` if not. The `Promise` will reject on Android if it was impossible to check if the URL can be opened, and on iOS if you didn't [add the specific scheme in the `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` key inside **Info.plist**](/guides/linking#linking-from-your-app).

### `Linking.collectManifestSchemes()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Collect a list of platform schemes from the manifest.

This method is based on the `Scheme` modules from `@expo/config-plugins` which are used for collecting the schemes before prebuilding a native app.

-   Android: `scheme` -> `android.scheme` -> `android.package`
-   iOS: `scheme` -> `ios.scheme` -> `ios.bundleIdentifier`

Returns: `string[]`

### `Linking.createURL(path, namedParameters)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | `string` | Addition path components to append to the base URL. |
| `namedParameters`(optional) | [CreateURLOptions](/versions/latest/sdk/linking#createurloptions) | Additional options object. Default: `{}` |

  

Helper method for constructing a deep link into your app, given an optional path and set of query parameters. Creates a URI scheme with two slashes by default.

The scheme must be defined in the [app config](/versions/latest/config/app) under `expo.scheme` or `expo.{android,ios}.scheme`. Platform-specific schemes defined under `expo.{android,ios}.scheme` take precedence over universal schemes defined under `expo.scheme`.

#### Examples

-   Development and production builds: `<scheme>://path` - uses the optional `scheme` property if provided, and otherwise uses the first scheme defined by your app config
-   Web (dev): `https://localhost:19006/path`
-   Web (prod): `https://myapp.com/path`
-   Expo Go (dev): `exp://128.0.0.1:8081/--/path`

The behavior of this method in Expo Go for published updates is undefined and should not be relied upon. The created URL in this case is neither stable nor predictable during the lifetime of the app. If a stable URL is needed, for example in authorization callbacks, a build (or development build) of your application should be used and the scheme provided.

Returns: `string`

A URL string which points to your app with the given deep link information.

### `Linking.getInitialURL()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Get the URL that was used to launch the app if it was launched by a link.

Returns: `Promise<string>`

The URL string that launched your app, or `null`.

### `Linking.getLinkingURL()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Get the URL that was used to launch the app if it was launched by a link.

Returns: `string | null`

The URL string that launched your app, or `null`.

### `Linking.hasConstantsManifest()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Ensure the user has linked the expo-constants manifest in bare workflow.

Returns: `boolean`

### `Linking.hasCustomScheme()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns: `boolean`

### `Linking.openSettings()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Open the operating system settings app and displays the app’s custom settings, if it has any.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `Linking.openURL(url)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | `string` | A URL for the operating system to open. For example: `tel:5555555`, `exp://`. |

  

Attempt to open the given URL with an installed app. See the [Linking guide](/guides/linking) for more information.

Returns: `Promise<true>`

A `Promise` that is fulfilled with `true` if the link is opened operating system automatically or the user confirms the prompt to open the link. The `Promise` rejects if there are no applications registered for the URL or the user cancels the dialog.

### `Linking.parse(url)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | `string` | A URL that points to the currently running experience (for example, an output of `Linking.createURL()`). |

  

Helper method for parsing out deep link information from a URL.

Returns: `ParsedURL`

A `ParsedURL` object.

### `Linking.parseInitialURLAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Helper method which wraps React Native's `Linking.getInitialURL()` in `Linking.parse()`. Parses the deep link information out of the URL used to open the experience initially. If no link opened the app, all the fields will be `null`.

> On the web it parses the current window URL.

Returns: `Promise<parsedurl>`

A promise that resolves with `ParsedURL` object.

### `Linking.resolveScheme(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options` | `{ isSilent: boolean, scheme: string }` |

  

Returns: `string`

### `Linking.sendIntent(action, extras)`

Supported platforms: Android.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |

| `extras`(optional) | [SendIntentExtras[]](#sendintentextras) |

  

Launch an Android intent with extras.

> Use [`expo-intent-launcher`](/versions/latest/sdk/intent-launcher) instead. `sendIntent` is only included in `Linking` for API compatibility with React Native's Linking API.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

## Event Subscriptions

### `Linking.addEventListener(type, handler)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `'url'` | The only valid type is `'url'`. |
| `handler` | [URLListener](/versions/latest/sdk/linking#urllistenerevent) | An [`URLListener`](#urllistener) function that takes an `event` object of the type [`EventType`](#eventtype). |

  

Add a handler to `Linking` changes by listening to the `url` event type and providing the handler. It is recommended to use the [`useURL()`](#useurl) hook instead.

Returns: `EmitterSubscription`

An EmitterSubscription that has the remove method from EventSubscription

# Expo LocalAuthentication

A library that provides functionality for implementing the Fingerprint API (Android) or FaceID and TouchID (iOS) to authenticate the user with a face or fingerprint scan.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

`expo-local-authentication` allows you to use the Biometric Prompt (Android) or FaceID and TouchID (iOS) to authenticate the user with a fingerprint or face scan.

## Known limitation

### iOS 

The FaceID authentication for iOS is not supported in Expo Go. You will need to create a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction) to test FaceID.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-local-authentication
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-local-authentication` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-local-authentication",
        {
          "faceIDPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use Face ID."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `faceIDPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use Face ID"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the [`NSFaceIDUsageDescription`](#permission-nsfaceidusagedescription) permission message. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using a native **ios** project manually, then you need to add `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` key to your **ios/[app]/Info.plist**:

```xml
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use FaceID</string>
```

## API

```js
import * as LocalAuthentication from 'expo-local-authentication';
```

## Methods

### `LocalAuthentication.authenticateAsync(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | [LocalAuthenticationOptions](#localauthenticationoptions) |

  

Attempts to authenticate via Fingerprint/TouchID (or FaceID if available on the device).

> **Note:** Apple requires apps which use FaceID to provide a description of why they use this API. If you try to use FaceID on an iPhone with FaceID without providing `infoPlist.NSFaceIDUsageDescription` in `app.json`, the module will authenticate using device passcode. For more information about usage descriptions on iOS, see [permissions guide](/guides/permissions#ios).

Returns: `Promise<localauthenticationresult>`

Returns a promise which fulfils with [`LocalAuthenticationResult`](#localauthenticationresult).

### `LocalAuthentication.cancelAuthenticate()`

Supported platforms: Android.

Cancels authentication flow.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `LocalAuthentication.getEnrolledLevelAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Determine what kind of authentication is enrolled on the device.

Returns: `Promise<securitylevel>`

Returns a promise which fulfils with [`SecurityLevel`](#securitylevel).

> **Note:** On Android devices prior to M, `SECRET` can be returned if only the SIM lock has been enrolled, which is not the method that [`authenticateAsync`](#localauthenticationauthenticateasyncoptions) prompts.

### `LocalAuthentication.hasHardwareAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Determine whether a face or fingerprint scanner is available on the device.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

Returns a promise which fulfils with a `boolean` value indicating whether a face or fingerprint scanner is available on this device.

### `LocalAuthentication.isEnrolledAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Determine whether the device has saved fingerprints or facial data to use for authentication.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

Returns a promise which fulfils to `boolean` value indicating whether the device has saved fingerprints or facial data for authentication.

### `LocalAuthentication.supportedAuthenticationTypesAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Determine what kinds of authentications are available on the device.

Returns: `Promise<authenticationtype[]>`

Returns a promise which fulfils to an array containing [`AuthenticationType`s](#authenticationtype).

Devices can support multiple authentication methods - i.e. `[1,2]` means the device supports both fingerprint and facial recognition. If none are supported, this method returns an empty array.

## Types

### `BiometricsSecurityLevel`

Supported platforms: Android.

Literal Type: `string`

Security level of the biometric authentication to allow.

Acceptable values are: `'weak'` | `'strong'`

### `LocalAuthenticationError`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Literal Type: `string`

One of the error values returned by the [`LocalAuthenticationResult`](#localauthenticationresult) object.

Acceptable values are: `'not_enrolled'` | `'user_cancel'` | `'app_cancel'` | `'not_available'` | `'lockout'` | `'no_space'` | `'timeout'` | `'unable_to_process'` | `'unknown'` | `'system_cancel'` | `'user_fallback'` | `'invalid_context'` | `'passcode_not_set'` | `'authentication_failed'`

### `LocalAuthenticationOptions`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| biometricsSecurityLevel(optional) | [BiometricsSecurityLevel](#biometricssecuritylevel) | Supported platforms: Android. Sets the security class of biometric authentication to allow. `strong` allows only Android Class 3 biometrics. For example, a fingerprint or a 3D face scan. `weak` allows both Android Class 3 and Class 2 biometrics. Class 2 biometrics are less secure than Class 3. For example, a camera-based face unlock. Default: `'weak'` |
| cancelLabel(optional) | `string` | Allows customizing the default `Cancel` label shown. |
| disableDeviceFallback(optional) | `boolean` | After several failed attempts, the system falls back to the device passcode. This setting allows you to disable this option and instead handle the fallback yourself. This can be preferable in certain custom authentication workflows. This behaviour maps to using the iOS [`LAPolicyDeviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/lapolicy/deviceownerauthenticationwithbiometrics) policy rather than the [`LAPolicyDeviceOwnerAuthentication`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/lapolicy/deviceownerauthentication?language=objc) policy. Defaults to `false`. |
| fallbackLabel(optional) | `string` | Supported platforms: iOS. Allows to customize the default `Use Passcode` label shown after several failed authentication attempts. Setting this option to an empty string disables this button from showing in the prompt. |
| promptDescription(optional) | `string` | Supported platforms: Android. A description displayed in the middle of the authentication prompt. |
| promptMessage(optional) | `string` | A message that is shown alongside the TouchID or FaceID prompt. |
| promptSubtitle(optional) | `string` | Supported platforms: Android. A subtitle displayed below the prompt message in the authentication prompt. |
| requireConfirmation(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: Android. Sets a hint to the system for whether to require user confirmation after authentication. This may be ignored by the system if the user has disabled implicit authentication in Settings or if it does not apply to a particular biometric modality. Defaults to `true`. |

### `LocalAuthenticationResult`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Type: `object` shaped as below:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| success | `true` | - |

Or `object` shaped as below:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| error | [LocalAuthenticationError](#localauthenticationerror) | - |
| success | `false` | - |
| warning(optional) | `string` | - |

## Enums

### `AuthenticationType`

# Expo Localization

A library that provides an interface for native user localization information.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-localization` allows you to Localize your app, customizing the experience for specific regions, languages, or cultures. It also provides access to the locale data on the native device. Using a localization library such as [`lingui-js`](https://lingui.dev/introduction), [`react-i18next`](https://react.i18next.com/), [`react-intl`](https://formatjs.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) or [`i18n-js`](https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js) with `expo-localization` will enable you to create a very accessible experience for users.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-localization
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-localization` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": ["expo-localization"]
  }
}
```

## Usage

Find more information about using `expo-localization` and adding support for right-to-left languages in the [Localization](/guides/localization) guide.

## API

```jsx
import { getLocales, getCalendars } from 'expo-localization';
```

### Behavior

You can use synchronous `getLocales()` and `getCalendars()` methods to get the locale settings of the user device. On iOS, the results will remain the same while the app is running.

On Android, the user can change locale preferences in Settings without restarting apps. To keep the localization current, you can rerun the `getLocales()` and `getCalendars()` methods every time the app returns to the foreground. Use `AppState` to detect this.

## Hooks

### `useCalendars()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

A hook providing a list of user's preferred calendars, returned as an array of objects of type `Calendar`. Guaranteed to contain at least 1 element. For now always returns a single element, but it's likely to return a user preference list on some platforms in the future. If the OS settings change, the hook will rerender with a new list of calendars.

Returns: `[Calendar, ...Calendar[]]`

Example

```js
[{
  "calendar": "gregory",
  "timeZone": "Europe/Warsaw",
  "uses24hourClock": true,
  "firstWeekday": 1
}]
```

### `useLocales()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

A hook providing a list of user's locales, returned as an array of objects of type `Locale`. Guaranteed to contain at least 1 element. These are returned in the order the user defines in their device settings. On the web currency and measurements systems are not provided, instead returned as null. If needed, you can infer them from the current region using a lookup table. If the OS settings change, the hook will rerender with a new list of locales.

Returns: `[Locale, ...Locale[]]`

Example

```js
[{
  "languageTag": "pl-PL",
  "languageCode": "pl",
  "textDirection": "ltr",
  "digitGroupingSeparator": " ",
  "decimalSeparator": ",",
  "measurementSystem": "metric",
  "currencyCode": "PLN",
  "currencySymbol": "zł",
  "regionCode": "PL",
  "temperatureUnit": "celsius"
}]
```

## Methods

### `Localization.getCalendars()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

List of user's preferred calendars, returned as an array of objects of type `Calendar`. Guaranteed to contain at least 1 element. For now always returns a single element, but it's likely to return a user preference list on some platforms in the future.

Returns: `[Calendar, ...Calendar[]]`

Example

```js
[{
  "calendar": "gregory",
  "timeZone": "Europe/Warsaw",
  "uses24hourClock": true,
  "firstWeekday": 1
}]
```

### `Localization.getLocales()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

List of user's locales, returned as an array of objects of type `Locale`. Guaranteed to contain at least 1 element. These are returned in the order the user defines in their device settings. On the web currency and measurements systems are not provided, instead returned as null. If needed, you can infer them from the current region using a lookup table.

Returns: `[Locale, ...Locale[]]`

Example

```js
[{
  "languageTag": "pl-PL",
  "languageCode": "pl",
  "textDirection": "ltr",
  "digitGroupingSeparator": " ",
  "decimalSeparator": ",",
  "measurementSystem": "metric",
  "currencyCode": "PLN",

Can be null on some browsers that don't support the [hourCycle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale/hourCycle) property in [Intl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) API. |

### `Locale`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| currencyCode | `string | null` | Currency code for the locale. On iOS, it's the currency code from the `Region` setting under Language & Region, not for the current locale. On Android, it's the currency specifc to the locale in the list, as there are no separate settings for selecting a region. Is `null` on Web, use a table lookup based on region instead. . Example. `'USD'`, `'EUR'`, `'PLN'`. |
| currencySymbol | `string | null` | Currency symbol for the currency specified by `currencyCode`. . Example. `'$'`, `'€'`, `'zł'`. |
| decimalSeparator | `string | null` | Decimal separator used for formatting numbers with fractional parts. . Example. `'.'`, `','`. |
| digitGroupingSeparator | `string | null` | Digit grouping separator used for formatting large numbers. . Example. `'.'`, `','`. |
| languageCode | `string | null` | An [IETF BCP 47 language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) without the region code. . Example. `'en'`, `'es'`, `'pl'`. |

# Expo Location

A library that provides access to reading geolocation information, polling current location or subscribing location update events from the device.
Android, iOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-location` allows reading geolocation information from the device. Your app can poll for the current location or subscribe to location update events.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-location
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-location` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-location",
        {
          "locationAlwaysAndWhenInUsePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `locationAlwaysAndWhenInUsePermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the [`NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`](#permission-nslocationalwaysandwheninuseusagedescription) permission message. |
| `locationAlwaysPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location"` | , Deprecated • Only for: iOS. A string to set the [`NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`](#permission-nslocationalwaysusagedescription) permission message. |
| `locationWhenInUsePermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the [`NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`](#permission-nslocationwheninuseusagedescription) permission message. |
| `isIosBackgroundLocationEnabled` | `false` | Only for: iOS. A boolean to enable `location` in the `UIBackgroundModes` in **Info.plist**. |
| `isAndroidBackgroundLocationEnabled` | `false` | Only for: Android. A boolean to enable the [`ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`](#permission-access_background_location) permission. |
| `isAndroidForegroundServiceEnabled` | - | Only for: Android. A boolean to enable the [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`](#permission-foreground_service) permission and [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION`](#permission-foreground_service_location). Defaults to `true` if `isAndroidBackgroundLocationEnabled` is `true`, otherwise `false`. |
| `androidForegroundServiceIcon` | - | Only for: Android. Local path to an image to use as the icon for the foreground service started by `startLocationUpdatesAsync`. 96x96 all-white png with transparency. If not set, the app icon will be used. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using native **ios** project manually, then you need to add the `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`, `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` and `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` keys to your project's **ios/[app]/Info.plist**:

```xml
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location</string>
```

### Background location

Background location allows your app to receive location updates while it is running in the background and includes both location updates and region monitoring through geofencing. This feature is subject to platform API limitations and system constraints:

-   Background location will stop if the user terminates the app.
-   Background location resumes if the user restarts the app.
-   Android A terminated app will not automatically restart when a location or geofencing event occurs due to platform limitations.
-   iOS The system will restart the terminated app when a new geofence event occurs.

> On Android, the result of removing an app from the recent apps list varies by device vendor. For example, some implementations treat removing an app from the recent apps list as killing it. Read more about these differences here: [https://dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com).

### Background location configuration 

To be able to run background location on iOS, you need to add the `location` value to the `UIBackgroundModes` array in your app's **Info.plist** file.

**If you're using [CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)**, the required `UIBackgroundModes` configuration will be applied automatically by prebuild.

Configure UIBackgroundModes manually on iOS

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using a native iOS project, then you'll need to add the following to your **Expo.plist** file:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
  <array>
    <string>location</string>
  </array>
```

### Background location methods

To use Background Location methods, the following requirements apply:

-   Location permissions must be granted.
-   Background location task must be defined in the top-level scope, using [`TaskManager.defineTask`](/versions/latest/sdk/task-manager#taskmanagerdefinetasktaskname-taskexecutor).
-   iOS `"location"` background mode must be specified in **Info.plist** file. See [Background location configuration](/versions/latest/sdk/location#background-location-configuration).
-   iOS You must use a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction) to use background location since it is not supported in the Expo Go app.

### Geofencing methods

To use Geofencing methods, the following requirements apply:

-   Location permissions must be granted.
-   The Geofencing task must be defined in the top-level scope, using [`TaskManager.defineTask`](/versions/latest/sdk/task-manager#taskmanagerdefinetasktaskname-taskexecutor).

When using Geofencing, the following platform differences apply:

-   Android You are allowed [up to 100](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/location/geofencing) active geofences per app.
-   iOS Expo Location will report the initial state of the registered geofence(s) at app startup.
-   iOS There is a [limit of 20](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/monitoring_the_user_s_proximity_to_geographic_regions) `regions` that can be simultaneously monitored.

### Background permissions

To use location tracking or Geofencing in the background, you must request the appropriate permissions:

-   On Android, you must request both foreground and background permissions.
-   On iOS, it must be granted with the `Always` option using [`requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationrequestbackgroundpermissionsasync).

Expo and iOS permissions

iOS permissions are divided into the two categories `When In Use` and `Always` and maps to Expo's foreground and background location permissions requested via:

-   [`requestForegroundPermissionsAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationrequestforegroundpermissionsasync) maps to `When In Use`
-   [`requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationrequestbackgroundpermissionsasync) maps to `Always`

> **Note:** When requesting `When In Use` authorization, the user can grant **temporary access** by selecting `Allow Once` in the system permission dialog. This authorization will be valid **only for the current app session** and is automatically revoked when the app is closed.

**Detecting "Allow Once" versus "Allow While Using the App"**

Unfortunately, **iOS does not provide a way to detect whether the user selected `Allow Once` or `Allow While Using the App`**. Both responses result in `When In Use` authorization.

If the user selected `Allow Once` and you subsequently call [`requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationrequestbackgroundpermissionsasync) in the same session, the system **will not show another prompt**. Instead, the request will **silently fail**, and the returned background permission status will be **denied**.

**Handling "Allow Once" scenarios**

If you suspect the user selected `Allow Once` and needs to request background permissions, they must **manually enable background location** in the Settings app. You can use `Linking` to open the Settings app within your app:

```js
import { Linking } from 'react-native';

function openSettings() {
  Linking.openURL('app-settings:');
}
```

**Incremental permission requests**

It is possible to request foreground location access first and then ask for background location access later. This can improve the user experience by requesting permissions only when necessary.

**Requesting Background Permissions directly**

If you call [`requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationrequestbackgroundpermissionsasync) without first requesting foreground permissions, iOS treats it as a request for both `When In Use` and `Always` authorization. The system will then prompt the user for `When In Use` access, and the `Always` authorization prompt will be displayed when the system determines that `Always` authorization is required.

Remember that the user has the option of granting your app `When In Use` authorization instead. You must always be prepared to run with `When In Use` permission.

## Deferred locations

When using background locations, you can configure the location manager to defer updates. This helps save battery by reducing update frequency. You can set updates to trigger only after the device has moved a certain distance or after a specified time interval.

Deferred updates are configured through [`LocationTaskOptions`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationtaskoptions) using the [`deferredUpdatesDistance`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationtaskoptions), [`deferredUpdatesInterval`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationtaskoptions) and [`deferredTimeout`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationtaskoptions) properties.

> Deferred locations apply only when the app is in the background.

## Usage

If you're using the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator, ensure that [Location is enabled](/versions/latest/sdk/location#enable-emulator-location).

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Platform, Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

import * as Location from 'expo-location';

export default function App() {
  const [location, setLocation] = useState<Location.LocationObject | null>(null);
  const [errorMsg, setErrorMsg] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function getCurrentLocation() {
      
      let { status } = await Location.requestForegroundPermissionsAsync();
      if (status !== 'granted') {
        setErrorMsg('Permission to access location was denied');
        return;
      }

      let location = await Location.getCurrentPositionAsync({});
      setLocation(location);
    }

    getCurrentLocation();
  }, []);

  let text = 'Waiting...';
  if (errorMsg) {
    text = errorMsg;
  } else if (location) {
    text = JSON.stringify(location);
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>{text}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  paragraph: {
    fontSize: 18,
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
});
```

## Enable emulator location

### Android Emulator

Open Android Studio, and launch the Android Emulator. Inside it, go to **Settings** > **Location** and enable **Use location**.

If you don't receive the locations in the emulator, you may have to turn off the **Improve Location Accuracy** setting. This will turn off Wi-Fi location and only use GPS. Then you can manipulate the location with GPS data through the emulator.

For Android 12 and higher, go to **Settings** > **Location** > **Location Services** > **Google Location Accuracy**, and turn off **Improve Location Accuracy**. For Android 11 and lower, go to **Settings** > **Location** > **Advanced** > **Google Location Accuracy**, and turn off **Google Location Accuracy**.

### iOS Simulator

With Simulator open, go to **Features** > **Location** and choose any option besides **None**.

## API

```js
import * as Location from 'expo-location';
```

## Hooks

### `useBackgroundPermissions(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | `PermissionHookOptions<object>` |

  

Check or request permissions for the background location. This uses both `requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync` and `getBackgroundPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns: `[PermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<permissionresponse>, GetPermissionMethod]</permissionresponse>`

Example

```ts
const [status, requestPermission] = Location.useBackgroundPermissions();
```

### `useForegroundPermissions(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | `PermissionHookOptions<object>` |

  

Check or request permissions for the foreground location. This uses both `requestForegroundPermissionsAsync` and `getForegroundPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns: `[LocationPermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<locationpermissionresponse>, GetPermissionMethod]</locationpermissionresponse>`

Example

```ts
const [status, requestPermission] = Location.useForegroundPermissions();
```

## Methods

### `Location.enableNetworkProviderAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android.

Asks the user to turn on high accuracy location mode which enables network provider that uses Google Play services to improve location accuracy and location-based services.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A promise resolving as soon as the user accepts the dialog. Rejects if denied.

### `Location.geocodeAsync(address)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `address` | `string` | A string representing address, eg. `"Baker Street London"`. |

  

Geocode an address string to latitude-longitude location.

On Android, you must request location permissions with [`requestForegroundPermissionsAsync`](#locationrequestforegroundpermissionsasync) before geocoding can be used.

> **Note**: Geocoding is resource consuming and has to be used reasonably. Creating too many requests at a time can result in an error, so they have to be managed properly. It's also discouraged to use geocoding while the app is in the background and its results won't be shown to the user immediately.

Returns: `Promise<locationgeocodedlocation[]>`

A promise which fulfills with an array (in most cases its size is 1) of [`LocationGeocodedLocation`](#locationgeocodedlocation) objects.

### `Location.getBackgroundPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Checks user's permissions for accessing location while the app is in the background.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type [`PermissionResponse`](#permissionresponse).

### `Location.getCurrentPositionAsync(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | [LocationOptions](#locationoptions) |

  

Requests for one-time delivery of the user's current location. Depending on given `accuracy` option it may take some time to resolve, especially when you're inside a building.

> **Note:** Calling it causes the location manager to obtain a location fix which may take several seconds. Consider using [`getLastKnownPositionAsync`](#locationgetlastknownpositionasyncoptions) if you expect to get a quick response and high accuracy is not required.

Returns: `Promise<locationobject>`

A promise which fulfills with an object of type [`LocationObject`](#locationobject).

### `Location.getForegroundPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Checks user's permissions for accessing location while the app is in the foreground.

Returns: `Promise<locationpermissionresponse>`

A promise that fulfills with an object of type [`LocationPermissionResponse`](#locationpermissionresponse).

### `Location.getHeadingAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Gets the current heading information from the device. To simplify, it calls `watchHeadingAsync` and waits for a couple of updates, and then returns the one that is accurate enough.

Returns: `Promise<locationheadingobject>`

A promise which fulfills with an object of type [`LocationHeadingObject`](#locationheadingobject).

### `Location.getLastKnownPositionAsync(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | [LocationLastKnownOptions](#locationlastknownoptions) |

  

Gets the last known position of the device or `null` if it's not available or doesn't match given requirements such as maximum age or required accuracy. It's considered to be faster than `getCurrentPositionAsync` as it doesn't request for the current location, but keep in mind the returned location may not be up-to-date.

Returns: `Promise<locationobject>`

A promise which fulfills with an object of type [`LocationObject`](#locationobject) or `null` if it's not available or doesn't match given requirements such as maximum age or required accuracy.

Returns: `void`

### `Location.isBackgroundLocationAvailableAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

### `Location.requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

Asks the user to grant permissions for location while the app is in the background. On **Android 11 or higher**: this method will open the system settings page - before that happens you should explain to the user why your application needs background location permission. For example, you can use `Modal` component from `react-native` to do that.

> **Note**: Foreground permissions should be granted before asking for the background permissions (your app can't obtain background permission without foreground permission).

Reverse geocode a location to postal address.

On Android, you must request location permissions with [`requestForegroundPermissionsAsync`](#locationrequestforegroundpermissionsasync) before geocoding can be used.

> **Note**: Geocoding is resource consuming and has to be used reasonably. Creating too many requests at a time can result in an error, so they have to be managed properly. It's also discouraged to use geocoding while the app is in the background and its results won't be shown to the user immediately.

Returns: `Promise<locationgeocodedaddress[]>`

A promise which fulfills with an array (in most cases its size is 1) of [`LocationGeocodedAddress`](#locationgeocodedaddress) objects.

import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';

 TaskManager.defineTask(YOUR_TASK_NAME, ({ data: { eventType, region }, error }) => {
  if (error) {
    // check `error.message` for more details.
    return;
  }
  if (eventType === GeofencingEventType.Enter) {
    console.log("You've entered region:", region);
  } else if (eventType === GeofencingEventType.Exit) {
    console.log("You've left region:", region);
  }

## Permissions

### Android

> Foreground and background services are not available in Expo Go for Android. Instead, we recommend using a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction) to avoid limitations.

When you install the `expo-location` module, it automatically adds the following permissions:

-   `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`: for approximate device location
-   `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`: for precise device location

The following permissions are optional:

-   `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION`: to be able to access location while the app is open but backgrounded. `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION` is only required as of Android 14. When you enable this in a new build, you will need to [submit your app for review and request access to use the foreground service permission](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13392821?hl=en).
-   `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`: to be able to access location while the app is backgrounded or closed. When you enable this in a new build, you will need to [submit your app for review and request access to use the background location permission](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9799150?hl=en).

| Android Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` | Allows an app to access approximate location. |
| `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` | Allows an app to access precise location. |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground. |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION` | Allows a regular application to use Service.startForeground with the type "location". |
| `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` | Allows an app to access location in the background. |

#### Excluding a permission

> **Note**: Excluding a **required permission** from a module in your app can break the functionality corresponding to that permission. Always make sure to include all permissions a module is dependent on.

When your Expo project doesn't benefit from having particular permission included, you can omit it. For example, if your application doesn't need access to the precise location, you can exclude the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission.

Another example can be stated using [available location accuracies](/versions/latest/sdk/location#accuracy). Android defines the approximate location accuracy estimation within about 3 square kilometers, and the precise location accuracy estimation within about 50 meters. For example, if the location accuracy value is [Low](/versions/latest/sdk/location#low), you can exclude `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission. To learn more about levels of location accuracies, see [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/location/permissions#accuracy).

To learn more on how to exclude permission, see [Excluding Android permissions](/guides/permissions#excluding-android-permissions).

### iOS

The following usage description keys are used by this library:

| Info.plist Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` | A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the user’s location information at all times. |
| `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` | A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the user's location at all times. DeprecatedFor apps deployed to targets in iOS 11 and later, use NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription instead. |
| `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` | A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the user’s location information while the app is running in the foreground. |

`NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` is deprecated in favor of `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` from iOS 11.

# react-native-maps

A library that provides a Map component that uses Google Maps on Android and Apple Maps or Google Maps on iOS.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

`react-native-maps` provides a Map component that uses Google Maps on Android and Apple Maps or Google Maps on iOS.

No additional setup is required when testing your project using Expo Go. However, **to deploy the app binary on app stores** additional steps are required for Google Maps. For more information, see the [instructions below](/versions/latest/sdk/map-view#deploy-app-with-google-maps).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install react-native-maps
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project. Then, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps/blob/master/docs/installation.md) provided in the library's README or documentation.

## Usage

See full documentation at [`react-native-maps/react-native-maps`](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps).

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import MapView from 'react-native-maps';
import { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <MapView style={styles.map} />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  map: {
    width: '100%',
    height: '100%',
  },
});
```

## Deploy app with Google Maps

### Android

> If you have already registered a project for another Google service on Android, such as Google Sign In, you enable the **Maps SDK for Android** on your project and jump to step 4.

#### Register a Google Cloud API project and enable the Maps SDK for Android

-   Open your browser to the [Google API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/apis) and create a project.
-   Once it's created, go to the project and enable the **Maps SDK for Android**.

#### Copy your app's SHA-1 certificate fingerprint

-   **If you are deploying your app to the Google Play Store**, you'll need to [upload your app binary to Google Play console](/submit/android) at least once. This is required for Google to generate your app signing credentials.
-   Go to the **[Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console) > (your app) > Test and release > App integrity > Play app signing > Settings > App signing key certificate**.
-   Copy the value of **SHA-1 certificate fingerprint**.

#### Create an API key

-   Go to [Google Cloud Credential manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and click **Create Credentials**, then **API Key**.
-   In the modal, click **Edit API key**.
-   Under **Key restrictions** > **Application restrictions**, choose **Android apps**.
-   Under **Restrict usage to your Android apps**, click **Add an item**.
-   Add your `android.package` from **app.json** (for example: `com.company.myapp`) to the package name field.
-   Then, add the **SHA-1 certificate fingerprint's** value from step 2.
-   Click **Done** and then click **Save**.

#### Add the API key to your project

Since you are using Google as the map provider, you need to add the API key to the `react-native-maps` [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction). Copy your **API Key** into your project to either a **.env** file or copy it directly and then add it to your app config under the `plugins.react-native-maps.androidGoogleMapsApiKey` field like:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "react-native-maps",
        {
          "androidGoogleMapsApiKey": "process.env.YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

-   In your code, import `{ PROVIDER_GOOGLE }` from `react-native-maps` and add the property `provider={PROVIDER_GOOGLE}` to your `<MapView>`. This property works on both Android and iOS.
-   Rebuild the app binary (or re-submit to the Google Play Store in case your app is already uploaded). An easy way to test if the configuration was successful is to do an [emulator build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build#build-the-native-app-ios-simulator).

### iOS

> If you have already registered a project for another Google service on iOS, such as Google Sign In, you enable the **Maps SDK for iOS** on your project and jump to step 3.

#### Register a Google Cloud API project and enable the Maps SDK for iOS

-   Open your browser to the [Google API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/apis) and create a project.
-   Then, go to the project, click **Enable APIs and Services** and enable the **Maps SDK for iOS**.

#### Create an API key

-   Go to [Google Cloud Credential manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and click **Create Credentials**, then **API Key**.
-   In the modal, click **Edit API key**.
-   Under **Key restrictions** > **Application restrictions**, choose **iOS apps**.
-   Under **Accept requests from an iOS application with one of these bundle identifiers**, click the **Add an item** button.
-   Add your `ios.bundleIdentifier` from **app.json** (for example: `com.company.myapp`) to the bundle ID field.
-   Click **Done** and then click **Save**.

#### Add the API key to your project

Since you are using Google as the map provider, you need to add the API key to the `react-native-maps` [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction). Copy your **API Key** into your project to either a **.env** file or copy it directly and then add it to your app config under the `plugins.react-native-maps.iosGoogleMapsApiKey` field like:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "react-native-maps",
        {
          "iosGoogleMapsApiKey": "process.env.YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

-   In your code, import `{ PROVIDER_GOOGLE }` from `react-native-maps` and add the property `provider={PROVIDER_GOOGLE}` to your `<MapView>`. This property works on both Android and iOS.
-   Rebuild the app binary. An easy way to test if the configuration was successful is to do a [simulator build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build#build-the-native-app-ios-simulator).

# Expo Maps

A library that provides access to Google Maps on Android and Apple Maps on iOS.
Android, iOS

> **This library is currently in alpha and will frequently experience breaking changes.** It is not available in the Expo Go app – use [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction) to try it out.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-maps
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

  

[Watch: Expo Maps Deep Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDCuaIQ9vd0)

## Configuration

Expo Maps provides access to the platform native map APIs on Android and iOS.

-   **Apple Maps (available on iOS only)**. No additional configuration is required to use it after installing this package.
-   **Google Maps (available on Android only)**. While Google provides a Google Maps SDK for iOS, Expo Maps supports it exclusively on Android. If you want to use Google Maps on iOS, you can look into using an [alternative library](https://reactnative.directory/) or [writing your own](/modules/overview).

### Google Cloud API setup

**Before you can use Google Maps on Android**, you need to register a Google Cloud API project, enable the Maps SDK for Android, and add the associated configuration to your Expo project.

Set up Google Maps on Android

> If you have already registered a project for another Google service on Android, such as Google Sign In, you enable the **Maps SDK for Android** on your project and jump to step 4.

**Register a Google Cloud API project and enable the Maps SDK for Android**

-   Open your browser to the [Google API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/apis) and create a project.
-   Once it's created, go to the project and enable the **Maps SDK for Android**.

**Copy your app's SHA-1 certificate fingerprint**

-   **If you are deploying your app to the Google Play Store**, you'll need to [upload your app binary to Google Play console](/submit/android) at least once. This is required for Google to generate your app signing credentials.
-   Go to the **[Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console) > (your app) > Release > Setup > App integrity > App Signing**.
-   Copy the value of **SHA-1 certificate fingerprint**.

**Create an API key**

-   Go to [Google Cloud Credential manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and click **Create Credentials**, then **API Key**.
-   In the modal, click **Edit API key**.
-   Under **Key restrictions** > **Application restrictions**, choose **Android apps**.
-   Under **Restrict usage to your Android apps**, click **Add an item**.
-   Add your `android.package` from **app.json** (for example: `com.company.myapp`) to the package name field.
-   Then, add the **SHA-1 certificate fingerprint's** value from step 2.
-   Click **Done** and then click **Save**.

**Add the API key to your project**

-   Copy your **API Key** into your **app.json** under the `android.config.googleMaps.apiKey` field.
-   Create a new development build, and you can now use the Google Maps API on Android with `expo-maps`.

## Permissions

To display the user's location on the map, you need to declare and request location permission beforehand. You can configure this using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-maps",
        {
          "requestLocationPermission": true,
          "locationPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `requestLocationPermission` | `false` | A boolean to add permissions to **AndroidManifest.xml** and **Info.plist**. |
| `locationPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the [`NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`](#permission-nslocationwheninuseusagedescription) permission message. |

## Usage

```tsx
import { AppleMaps, GoogleMaps } from 'expo-maps';
import { Platform, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
    return <AppleMaps.View style={{ flex: 1 }} />;
  } else if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    return <GoogleMaps.View style={{ flex: 1 }} />;
  } else {
    return <Text>Maps are only available on Android and iOS</Text>;
  }

# @react-native-masked-view/masked-view

A library that provides a masked view.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Included in Expo Go

`@react-native-masked-view/masked-view` provides a masked view that only displays the pixels that overlap with the view rendered in its mask element.

> You can only have one of either `@react-native-community/masked-view` (deprecated) or `@react-native-masked-view/masked-view` installed in your project at any given time. React Navigation v6 and later requires `@react-native-masked-view/masked-view`, so you should use that package instead if you are using the latest version of React Navigation.

> Android support for this library is experimental and you may encounter inconsistencies in behavior across platforms. Report issues you encounter to [`react-native-masked-view` GitHub repository](https://github.com/react-native-masked-view/masked-view).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @react-native-masked-view/masked-view
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project. Then, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/react-native-masked-view/masked-view#getting-started) provided in the library's README or documentation.

# Expo MediaLibrary

A library that provides access to the device's media library.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Included in Expo Go

`expo-media-library` provides access to the user's media library, allowing them to access their existing images and videos from your app, as well as save new ones. You can also subscribe to any updates made to the user's media library.

> Android allows full access to the media library (which is the purpose of this package) only for applications needing broad access to photos. See [Details on Google Play's Photo and Video Permissions policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/14115180).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-media-library
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-media-library` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-media-library",
        {
          "photosPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your photos.",
          "savePhotosPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to save photos.",
          "isAccessMediaLocationEnabled": true,
          "granularPermissions": ["audio", "photo"]
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `photosPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your photos."` | Only for: iOS. Sets the iOS `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` permission message in **Info.plist**. |
| `savePhotosPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to save photos."` | Only for: iOS. Sets the iOS `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` permission message in **Info.plist**. |
| `preventAutomaticLimitedAccessAlert` | `false` | Only for: iOS. Prevents the automatic limited access alert from being shown when the user has limited access to the photo library. Useful for apps that want to access only the limited photo library without having iOS forcibly show the alert. |
| `isAccessMediaLocationEnabled` | `false` | Only for: Android. Sets whether or not to request the `ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION` permission on Android. |
| `granularPermissions` | `["photo", "video", "audio"]` | Only for: Android. Sets which [`GranularPermission`](#granularpermission) values to include, determining which media permissions (`READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`, `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`) will be added to the Android manifest. Matches the behavior of the runtime API. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using native **android** and **ios** projects manually, then you need to add following permissions and configuration to your native projects:

**Android**

-   To access asset location (latitude and longitude EXIF tags), add `ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION` permission to your project's **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**:
    
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION" />
    ```
    
-   [Scoped storage](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage#scoped-storage) is available from Android 10. To make `expo-media-library` work with scoped storage, you need to add the following configuration to your **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**:
    
    ```xml
    <manifest ... >
      <application android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" ...>
    </manifest>
    ```
    

**iOS**

-   Add `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`, and `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` keys to your project's **ios/[app]/Info.plist**:
    
    ```xml
    <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to access your photos</string>
    <key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to save photos</string>
    ```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Button, Text, ScrollView, StyleSheet, Image, View, Platform } from 'react-native';
import * as MediaLibrary from 'expo-media-library';

export default function App() {
  const [albums, setAlbums] = useState(null);
  const [permissionResponse, requestPermission] = MediaLibrary.usePermissions();

  async function getAlbums() {
    if (permissionResponse.status !== 'granted') {
      await requestPermission();
    }
    const fetchedAlbums = await MediaLibrary.getAlbumsAsync({
      includeSmartAlbums: true,
    });
    setAlbums(fetchedAlbums);
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button onPress={getAlbums} title="Get albums" />
      <ScrollView>
        {albums && albums.map((album) => <AlbumEntry album={album} />)}
      </ScrollView>
    </View>
  );
}

function AlbumEntry({ album }) {
  const [assets, setAssets] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function getAlbumAssets() {
      const albumAssets = await MediaLibrary.getAssetsAsync({ album });
      setAssets(albumAssets.assets);
    }
    getAlbumAssets();
  }, [album]);

  return (
    <View key={album.id} style={styles.albumContainer}>
      <Text>
        {album.title} - {album.assetCount ?? 'no'} assets
      </Text>
      <View style={styles.albumAssetsContainer}>
        {assets && assets.map((asset) => (
          <Image source={{ uri: asset.uri }} width={50} height={50} />
        ))}
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({ ... });
```

## Known limitations

### Empty albums

Due to system limitations on Android, it is impossible to create empty albums. It is necessary to either pass an existing asset to add to the album or a URI of a local resource, which will be used to create a new asset inside the album.

### Moving assets between albums

Android 11 introduced permission changes that make the operation of moving assets between albums require confirmation from the user every time. Therefore, when creating a new asset, instead of creating the asset and then moving it to the album, it is recommended to pass the `album` parameter to the [`createAssetAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/media-library#medialibrarycreateassetasynclocaluri-album) method, which will automatically add the asset to the album without the need for user confirmation.

### Wrong orientation of images

On Android, when using `getAssetsAsync` without `resolveWithFullInfo: true`, image orientation may be incorrect because EXIF data (which includes orientation) is only read when that option is enabled.

## API

```js
import * as MediaLibrary from 'expo-media-library';
```

## Component

### `getAlbumsAsync`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: React.[Element](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#function-component)<[AlbumsOptions](#albumsoptions)\>

Queries for user-created albums in media gallery.

## Constants

### `MediaLibrary.MediaType`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: [MediaTypeObject](#mediatypeobject)

Possible media types.

### `MediaLibrary.SortBy`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: [SortByObject](#sortbyobject)

Supported keys that can be used to sort `getAssetsAsync` results.

## Hooks

### `usePermissions(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | PermissionHookOptions<{ granularPermissions: [GranularPermission[]](#granularpermission), writeOnly: boolean }\> |

  

Check or request permissions to access the media library. This uses both `requestPermissionsAsync` and `getPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns: `[PermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<permissionresponse>, GetPermissionMethod]</permissionresponse>`

Example

```ts
const [permissionResponse, requestPermission] = MediaLibrary.usePermissions();
```

## Methods

### `MediaLibrary.addAssetsToAlbumAsync(assets, album, copy)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assets` | [AssetRef](#assetref) | [AssetRef[]](#assetref) | An array of [Asset](#asset) or their IDs. |
| `album` | [AlbumRef](#albumref) | An [Album](#album) or its ID. |
| `copy`(optional) | `boolean` | **Android only.** Whether to copy assets to the new album instead of move them. Defaults to `true`. Default: `true` |

  

Adds array of assets to the album.

On Android, by default it copies assets from the current album to provided one, however it's also possible to move them by passing `false` as `copyAssets` argument. In case they're copied you should keep in mind that `getAssetsAsync` will return duplicated assets.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

Returns promise which fulfils with `true` if the assets were successfully added to the album.

### `MediaLibrary.createAlbumAsync(albumName, asset, copyAsset, initialAssetLocalUri)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `albumName` | `string` | Name of the album to create. |
| `asset`(optional) | [AssetRef](#assetref) | An [Asset](#asset) or its ID. On Android you either need to provide an asset or a localUri. |
| `copyAsset`(optional) | `boolean` | **Android Only.** Whether to copy asset to the new album instead of move it. This parameter is ignored if `asset` was not provided. Defaults to `true`. Default: `true` |
| `initialAssetLocalUri`(optional) | `string` | A URI to the local media file, which will be used to create the initial asset inside the album. It must contain an extension. On Android it must be a local path, so it must start with `file:///`. If the `asset` was provided, this parameter will be ignored. |

  

Creates an album with given name and initial asset. The asset parameter is required on Android, since it's not possible to create empty album on this platform. On Android, by default it copies given asset from the current album to the new one, however it's also possible to move it by passing `false` as `copyAsset` argument. In case it's copied you should keep in mind that `getAssetsAsync` will return duplicated asset.

> On Android, it's not possible to create an empty album. You must provide an existing asset to copy or move into the album or an uri of a local file, which will be used to create an initial asset for the album.

Returns: `Promise<album>`

Newly created [`Album`](#album).

### `MediaLibrary.migrateAlbumIfNeededAsync(album)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `album` | [AlbumRef](#albumref) | An [Album](#album) or its ID. |

  

Moves album content to the special media directories on **Android R** or **above** if needed. Those new locations are in line with the Android `scoped storage` - so your application won't lose write permission to those directories in the future.

This method does nothing if:

-   app is running on **iOS**, **web** or **Android below R**
-   app has **write permission** to the album folder

The migration is possible when the album contains only compatible files types. For instance, movies and pictures are compatible with each other, but music and pictures are not. If automatic migration isn't possible, the function rejects. In that case, you can use methods from the `expo-file-system` to migrate all your files manually.

#### Why do you need to migrate files?

**Android R** introduced a lot of changes in the storage system. Now applications can't save anything to the root directory. The only available locations are from the `MediaStore` API. Unfortunately, the media library stored albums in folders for which, because of those changes, the application doesn't have permissions anymore. However, it doesn't mean you need to migrate all your albums. If your application doesn't add assets to albums, you don't have to migrate. Everything will work as it used to. You can read more about scoped storage in [the Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage).

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A promise which fulfils to `void`.

### `MediaLibrary.presentPermissionsPickerAsync(mediaTypes)`

Supported platforms: Android 14+, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mediaTypes`(optional) | [MediaTypeFilter[]](#mediatypefilter) | Limits the type(s) of media that the user will be granting access to. By default, a list that shows both photos and videos is presented. |

  

Allows the user to update the assets that your app has access to. The system modal is only displayed if the user originally allowed only `limited` access to their media library, otherwise this method is a no-op.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A promise that either rejects if the method is unavailable, or resolves to `void`.

> **Note:** This method doesn't inform you if the user changes which assets your app has access to. That information is only exposed by iOS, and to obtain it, you need to subscribe for updates to the user's media library using [`addListener()`](#medialibraryaddlistenerlistener). If `hasIncrementalChanges` is `false`, the user changed their permissions.

### `MediaLibrary.removeAssetsFromAlbumAsync(assets, album)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assets` | [AssetRef](#assetref) | [AssetRef[]](#assetref) | An array of [Asset](#asset) or their IDs. |
| `album` | [AlbumRef](#albumref) | An [Album](#album) or its ID. |

  

Removes given assets from album.

On Android, album will be automatically deleted if there are no more assets inside.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

| `granularPermissions`(optional) | [GranularPermission[]](#granularpermission) | A list of [`GranularPermission`](#granularpermission) values. This parameter has an effect only on Android 13 and newer. By default, `expo-media-library` will ask for all possible permissions. When using granular permissions with a custom config plugin configuration, make sure that all the requested permissions are included in the plugin. |

  

Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing media in user's media library.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

A promise that fulfils with [`PermissionResponse`](#permissionresponse) object.

### `MediaLibrary.saveToLibraryAsync(localUri)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `localUri` | `string` | A URI to the image or video file. It must contain an extension. On Android it must be a local path, so it must start with `file:///`. |

  

Saves the file at given `localUri` to the user's media library. Unlike [`createAssetAsync()`](#medialibrarycreateassetasynclocaluri), This method doesn't return created asset. On **iOS 11+**, it's possible to use this method without asking for `CAMERA_ROLL` permission, however then yours `Info.plist` should have `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` key.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

# Expo NavigationBar

A library that provides access to various interactions with the native navigation bar on Android.
Android, Included in Expo Go

`expo-navigation-bar` enables you to modify and observe the native navigation bar on Android devices. Due to some Android platform restrictions, parts of this API overlap with the `expo-status-bar` API.

Properties are named after style properties; visibility, position, backgroundColor, borderColor, and so on.

The APIs in this package have no impact when "Gesture Navigation" is enabled on the Android device. There is currently no native Android API to detect if "Gesture Navigation" is enabled or not.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-navigation-bar
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-navigation-bar` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-navigation-bar",
        {
          "backgroundColor": "#0f172a",
          "barStyle": "light",
          "borderColor": "#1f2937",
          "visibility": "visible",
          "behavior": "inset-swipe",
          "position": "relative"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `backgroundColor` | `undefined` | Sets the navigation bar background color. Accepts color string supported by React Native. For example, `"#0f172a"`. |
| `barStyle` | `undefined` | Controls whether Android renders light or dark navigation bar buttons. Accepts `light` and `dark` as values. |
| `borderColor` | `undefined` | Sets the divider color above the navigation bar. Automatically converts the color string to a 32-bit integer. |
| `visibility` | `undefined` | Determines whether the navigation bar starts visible or hidden. Accepts `visible` to show the bar immediately and `hidden` to hide it until the user reveals it with a system gesture. |
| `behavior` | `undefined` | Controls how hidden system bars behave when revealed. Accepts `overlay-swipe`, `inset-swipe`, or `inset-touch` as values. |
| `position` | `undefined` | Sets whether your layout is inset for the navigation bar. Accepts `relative` to keep the navigation bar outside the content and `absolute` to draw the content edge-to-edge under the bar. |
| `legacyVisible` | `undefined` | Legacy equivalent of `androidNavigationBar.visible`. Accepts `leanback`, `immersive`, or `sticky-immersive` as values. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using a native **android** project manually, then you need to add the following configuration to your native project:

-   To apply `backgroundColor` to the navigation bar, add `navigationBarColor` to **android/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml**:
    
    ```xml
    <resources>
      <!-- ... -->
      <color name="navigationBarColor">#0f172a</color>
    </resources>
    ```
    
    Then, apply `android:navigationBarColor` to **android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml**:
    
    ```xml
    <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.DayNight.NoActionBar">
      <!-- ... -->
      <item name="android:navigationBarColor">@color/navigationBarColor</item>
    </style>
    ```
    
-   To apply `borderColor`, `visibility`, `position`, and `behavior` to the navigation bar, add `expo_navigation_bar_border_color`, `expo_navigation_bar_visibility`, `expo_navigation_bar_position`, and `expo_navigation_bar_behavior` to **android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml**:
    
    ```xml
    <resources>
      <!-- ... -->
      <!-- For `expo_navigation_bar_border_color`, convert the color string to a 32-bit integer. -->
      <string name="expo_navigation_bar_border_color"
      translatable="false">-14735049</string>
      <string name="expo_navigation_bar_visibility" translatable="false">visible</string>
      <string name="expo_navigation_bar_position" translatable="false">relative</string>
      <string name="expo_navigation_bar_behavior" translatable="false">inset-swipe</string>
    </resources>
    ```
    
-   To apply `legacyVisible` to the navigation bar, add `expo_navigation_bar_legacy_visible` to **android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml**:
    
    ```xml
    <resources>
      <!-- ... -->
      <string name="expo_navigation_bar_legacy_visible" translatable="false">immersive</string>
    </resources>
    ```

```

> **Deprecated:** Due to Android edge-to-edge enforcement, setting the navigation bar position is deprecated and has no effect. This will be removed in a future release.

### `NavigationBar.setPositionAsync(position)`

Supported platforms: Android.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `position` | [NavigationBarPosition](#navigationbarposition) | Based on CSS position property. |

  

Sets positioning method used for the navigation bar (and status bar). Setting position `absolute` will float the navigation bar above the content, whereas position `relative` will shrink the screen to inline the navigation bar.

When drawing behind the status and navigation bars, ensure the safe area insets are adjusted accordingly.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

Example

```ts
// enables edge-to-edge mode

> Due to a bug in the Android 15 emulator this function may have no effect. Try a physical device or an emulator with a different version of Android.

Returns: `void`

### `NavigationBar.setVisibilityAsync(visibility)`

Supported platforms: Android.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `visibility` | [NavigationBarVisibility](#navigationbarvisibility) | Based on CSS visibility property. |

  

Set the navigation bar's visibility.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

Example

```ts
NavigationBar.setVisibilityAsync("hidden");
```

> **Deprecated:** Due to Android edge-to-edge enforcement, getting the navigation bar position is deprecated and always returns `relative`. This will be removed in a future release.

### `NavigationBar.unstable_getPositionAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android.

Whether the navigation and status bars float above the app (absolute) or sit inline with it (relative). This value can be incorrect if `androidNavigationBar.visible` is used instead of the config plugin `position` property.

This method is unstable because the position can be set via another native module and get out of sync. Alternatively, you can get the position by measuring the insets returned by `react-native-safe-area-context`.

Returns: `Promise<navigationbarposition>`

Navigation bar positional rendering mode. Returns `relative` on unsupported platforms (iOS, web).

Example

```ts
await NavigationBar.unstable_getPositionAsync()

# @react-native-community/netinfo

A cross-platform API that provides access to network information.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`@react-native-community/netinfo` allows you to get information about connection type and connection quality.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @react-native-community/netinfo
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project. Then, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo#getting-started) provided in the library's README or documentation.

## API

To import this library, use:

```js
import NetInfo from '@react-native-community/netinfo';
```

If you want to grab information about the network connection just once, you can use:

```js
NetInfo.fetch().then(state => {
  console.log('Connection type', state.type);
  console.log('Is connected?', state.isConnected);
});
```

Or, if you'd rather subscribe to updates about the network state (which then allows you to run code/perform actions anytime the network state changes) use:

```js
const unsubscribe = NetInfo.addEventListener(state => {
  console.log('Connection type', state.type);
  console.log('Is connected?', state.isConnected);
});

// To unsubscribe to these update, just use:
unsubscribe();
```

## Accessing the SSID

To access the `ssid` property (available under `state.details.ssid`), there are a few additional configuration steps:

-   Request location permissions with [`Location.requestForegroundPermissionsAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationrequestforegroundpermissionsasync) or [`Location.requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#locationrequestbackgroundpermissionsasync).

### iOS only

-   Add the `com.apple.developer.networking.wifi-info` entitlement to your **app.json** under `ios.entitlements`:
    
    ```json
    "ios": {
        "entitlements": {
          "com.apple.developer.networking.wifi-info": true
        }
      }
    ```
    
-   Check the **Access Wi-Fi Information** box in your app's App Identifier, [which can be found here](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list).
    
-   Rebuild your app with [`eas build --platform ios`](/build/setup#4-run-a-build) or [`npx expo run:ios`](/more/expo-cli#compiling).

# Expo Network

A library that provides access to the device's network such as its IP address, MAC address, and airplane mode status.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-network` provides useful information about the device's network such as its IP address, MAC address, and airplane mode status.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-network
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration

On Android, this module requires permissions to access the network and Wi-Fi state. The permissions `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` and `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` are added automatically.

## API

```js
import * as Network from 'expo-network';
```

## Hooks

### `useNetworkState()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns the current network state of the device. This method initiates a listener for network state changes and cleans up before unmounting.

Returns: `NetworkState`

The current network state of the device, including connectivity and type.

Example

```ts
const networkState = useNetworkState();
console.log(`Current network type: ${networkState.type}`);
```

## Methods

### `Network.getIpAddressAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Gets the device's current IPv4 address. Returns `0.0.0.0` if the IP address could not be retrieved.

On web, this method uses the third-party [`ipify service`](https://www.ipify.org/) to get the public IP address of the current device.

Returns: `Promise<string>`

A `Promise` that fulfils with a `string` of the current IP address of the device's main network interface. Can only be IPv4 address.

Example

```ts
await Network.getIpAddressAsync();
// "92.168.32.44"
```

### `Network.getNetworkStateAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Gets the device's current network connection state.

On web, `navigator.connection.type` is not available on browsers. So if there is an active network connection, the field `type` returns `NetworkStateType.UNKNOWN`. Otherwise, it returns `NetworkStateType.NONE`.

Returns: `Promise<networkstate>`

A `Promise` that fulfils with a `NetworkState` object.

Example

```ts
await Network.getNetworkStateAsync();
// {
//   type: NetworkStateType.CELLULAR,
//   isConnected: true,
//   isInternetReachable: true,
// }
```

### `Network.isAirplaneModeEnabledAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android.

Tells if the device is in airplane mode.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

Returns a `Promise` that fulfils with a `boolean` value for whether the device is in airplane mode or not.

Example

```ts
await Network.isAirplaneModeEnabledAsync();
// false
```

## Event Subscriptions

### `Network.addNetworkStateListener(listener)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listener` | (event: [NetworkState](#networkstate)) => void | Callback to execute when the network state changes. The callback is provided with a single argument that is an object containing information about the network state. |

  

Adds a listener that will fire whenever the network state changes.

Returns: `EventSubscription`

A subscription object with a remove function to unregister the listener.

Example

```ts
const subscription = addNetworkStateListener(({ type, isConnected, isInternetReachable }) => {
  console.log(`Network type: ${type}, Connected: ${isConnected}, Internet Reachable: ${isInternetReachable}`);
});
```

## Types

### `NetworkState`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| isConnected(optional) | `boolean` | If there is an active network connection. Note that this does not mean that internet is reachable. This field is `false` if the type is either `Network.NetworkStateType.NONE` or `Network.NetworkStateType.UNKNOWN`, `true` otherwise. |
| isInternetReachable(optional) | `boolean` | If the internet is reachable with the currently active network connection. On Android, this depends on `NetInfo.isConnected()` (API level < 29) or `ConnectivityManager.getActiveNetwork()` (API level >= 29). On iOS, this value will always be the same as `isConnected`. |
| type(optional) | [NetworkStateType](#networkstatetype) | A [`NetworkStateType`](#networkstatetype) enum value that represents the current network connection type. |

### `NetworkStateEvent`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

# Expo Notifications

A library that provides an API to fetch push notification tokens and to present, schedule, receive and respond to notifications.
Android (device only), iOS (device only)

`expo-notifications` provides an API to fetch push notification tokens and to present, schedule, receive and respond to notifications.

[Notification guides](/push-notifications/overview) — Do not miss our guides on how to set up, send, and handle push notifications.

> Push notifications (remote notifications) functionality provided by `expo-notifications` is unavailable in Expo Go on Android from SDK 53. A [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction) is required to use push notifications. Local notifications (in-app notifications) remain available in Expo Go.

## Features

-   Schedule a one-off notification for a specific date or some time from now
-   Schedule a notification repeating in some time interval (or a calendar date match on iOS)
-   Get and set the application badge icon number
-   Obtain a native device push token, so you can send push notifications with FCM (for Android) and APNs (for iOS)
-   Obtain an Expo push token, so you can send push notifications with [Expo Push Service](/push-notifications/sending-notifications)
-   Listen to incoming notifications in the foreground and background
-   Listen to interactions with notifications
-   Handle notifications when the app is in the foreground
-   Imperatively dismiss notifications from Notification Center/tray
-   Create, update, and delete [Android notification channels](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/channels)
-   Set custom icon and color for notifications on Android

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-notifications
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

  

Then proceed to [configuration](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#configuration) to set up the [config plugin](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#app-config) and obtain the [credentials](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#credentials) for push notifications.

### Known issues

When launching the app from a push notification in **Android development builds**, the splash screen may fail to display correctly about 70% of the time. The icon and fade animation may not appear as expected.

-   Icon may be missing
-   Fade animation may not run
-   Only the background color may flash briefly

This issue only affects debug builds and does not occur in release builds. To workaround it, test notification launches in release mode (`npx expo run:android --variant release`) for accurate behavior.

## Usage

Check out the example Snack below to see Notifications in action, make sure to use a physical device to test it. Push notifications don't work on emulators/simulators.

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { Text, View, Button, Platform } from 'react-native';
import * as Device from 'expo-device';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
import Constants from 'expo-constants';

Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldPlaySound: false,
    shouldSetBadge: false,
    shouldShowBanner: true,
    shouldShowList: true,
  }),
});

export default function App() {
  const [expoPushToken, setExpoPushToken] = useState('');
  const [channels, setChannels] = useState<Notifications.NotificationChannel[]>([]);
  const [notification, setNotification] = useState<Notifications.Notification | undefined>(
    undefined
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    registerForPushNotificationsAsync().then(token => token && setExpoPushToken(token));

    if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
      Notifications.getNotificationChannelsAsync().then(value => setChannels(value ?? []));
    }
    const notificationListener = Notifications.addNotificationReceivedListener(notification => {
      setNotification(notification);
    });

    const responseListener = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(response => {
      console.log(response);
    });

    return () => {
      notificationListener.remove();
      responseListener.remove();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'space-around',
      }}>
      <Text>Your expo push token: {expoPushToken}</Text>
      <Text>{`Channels: ${JSON.stringify(
        channels.map(c => c.id),
        null,
        2
      )}`}</Text>
      <View style={{ alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
        <Text>Title: {notification && notification.request.content.title} </Text>
        <Text>Body: {notification && notification.request.content.body}</Text>
        <Text>Data: {notification && JSON.stringify(notification.request.content.data)}</Text>
      </View>
      <Button
        title="Press to schedule a notification"
        onPress={async () => {
          await schedulePushNotification();
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

async function schedulePushNotification() {
  await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
    content: {
      title: "You've got mail! 📬",
      body: 'Here is the notification body',
      data: { data: 'goes here', test: { test1: 'more data' } },
    },
    trigger: {
      type: Notifications.SchedulableTriggerInputTypes.TIME_INTERVAL,
      seconds: 2,
    },
  });
}

async function registerForPushNotificationsAsync() {
  let token;

  if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    await Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('myNotificationChannel', {
      name: 'A channel is needed for the permissions prompt to appear',
      importance: Notifications.AndroidImportance.MAX,
      vibrationPattern: [0, 250, 250, 250],
      lightColor: '#FF231F7C',
    });
  }

  if (Device.isDevice) {
    const { status: existingStatus } = await Notifications.getPermissionsAsync();
    let finalStatus = existingStatus;
    if (existingStatus !== 'granted') {
      const { status } = await Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync();
      finalStatus = status;
    }
    if (finalStatus !== 'granted') {
      alert('Failed to get push token for push notification!');
      return;
    }
    // Learn more about projectId:
    // https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/push-notifications-setup/#configure-projectid
    // EAS projectId is used here.
    try {
      const projectId =
        Constants?.expoConfig?.extra?.eas?.projectId ?? Constants?.easConfig?.projectId;
      if (!projectId) {
        throw new Error('Project ID not found');
      }
      token = (
        await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync({
          projectId,
        })
      ).data;
      console.log(token);
    } catch (e) {
      token = `${e}`;
    }
  } else {
    alert('Must use physical device for Push Notifications');
  }

  return token;
}
```

### Present a local (in-app) notification to the user

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

// First, set the handler that will cause the notification
// to show the alert
Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldPlaySound: false,
    shouldSetBadge: false,
    shouldShowBanner: true,
    shouldShowList: true,
  }),
});

// Second, call scheduleNotificationAsync()
Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: 'Look at that notification',
    body: "I'm so proud of myself!",
  },
  trigger: null,
});
```

### Handle push notifications with navigation

If you'd like to deep link to a specific screen in your app when you receive a push notification, you can configure either of Expo's navigation systems to do that.

You can use Expo Router's [built-in deep linking](/router/basics/core-concepts#2-all-pages-have-a-url) to handle incoming URLs from push notifications. Simply configure the root layout to listen for incoming and initial notification events.

```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
import { router } from 'expo-router';

function useNotificationObserver() {
  useEffect(() => {
    function redirect(notification: Notifications.Notification) {
      const url = notification.request.content.data?.url;
      if (typeof url === 'string') {
        router.push(url);
      }
    }

    const response = Notifications.getLastNotificationResponse();
    if (response?.notification) {
      redirect(response.notification);
    }

    const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(response => {
      redirect(response.notification);
    });

    return () => {
      subscription.remove();
    };
  }, []);
}

export default function Layout() {
  useNotificationObserver();

  return <Slot />;
}
```

## Configuration

### Credentials

Follow the [setup guide](/push-notifications/push-notifications-setup#get-credentials-for-development-builds).

### App config

To configure `expo-notifications`, use the built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) in the app config (**app.json** or **app.config.js**) for [EAS Build](/build/introduction) or with `npx expo run:[android|ios]`. The plugin allows you to configure the following properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect:

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `icon` | - | Only for: Android. Local path to an image to use as the icon for push notifications. 96x96 all-white png with transparency. |
| `color` | `#ffffff` | Only for: Android. Tint color for the push notification image when it appears in the notification tray. |
| `defaultChannel` | - | Only for: Android. Default channel for FCMv1 notifications. |
| `sounds` | - | Array of local paths to sound files (.wav recommended) that can be used as custom notification sounds. Sound will not be played when focus mode does not permit it or silent mode is on. |
| `enableBackgroundRemoteNotifications` | `false` | Only for: iOS. Whether to enable background remote notifications, as described in [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/pushing-background-updates-to-your-app). This updates the `UIBackgroundModes` key in the `Info.plist` to include `remote-notification`. |

Here is an example of using the config plugin in the app config file:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-notifications",
        {
          "icon": "./local/assets/notification_icon.png",
          "color": "#ffffff",
          "defaultChannel": "default",
          "sounds": [
            "./local/assets/notification_sound.wav",
            "./local/assets/notification_sound_other.wav"
          ],
          "enableBackgroundRemoteNotifications": false
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

> The iOS APNs entitlement is _always_ set to 'development'. Xcode automatically changes this to 'production' in the archive generated by a release build. [Learn more](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42293632/4047926).

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

Learn how to configure the native projects in the [installation instructions in the `expo-notifications` repository](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-notifications#installation-in-bare-react-native-projects).

## Permissions

### Android

-   On Android, this module requires permission to subscribe to the device boot. It's used to set up scheduled notifications when the device (re)starts. The `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` permission is added automatically through the library's **AndroidManifest.xml**.
    
-   Starting from Android 12 (API level 31), to schedule a notification that triggers at an exact time, you need to add `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM"/>` to **AndroidManifest.xml**. Read more about the [exact alarm permission](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#exact-alarm-permission).
    
-   On Android 13, app users must opt-in to receive notifications via a permissions prompt automatically triggered by the operating system. This prompt will not appear until at least one notification channel is created. The `setNotificationChannelAsync` must be called before `getDevicePushTokenAsync` or `getExpoPushTokenAsync` to obtain a push token. You can read more about the new notification permission behavior for Android 13 in the [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/notification-permission#new-apps).
    

| Android Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. |
| `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` | Allows applications to use exact alarm APIs. |

### iOS

No usage description is required, see [notification-related permissions](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#fetch-information-about-notifications-related-permissions).

### Interpret the iOS permissions response

On iOS, permissions for sending notifications are a little more granular than they are on Android. This is why you should rely on the `NotificationPermissionsStatus`'s `ios.status` field, instead of the root `status` field.

This value will be one of the following, accessible under `Notifications.IosAuthorizationStatus`:

-   `NOT_DETERMINED`: The user hasn't yet made a choice about whether the app is allowed to schedule notifications
-   `DENIED`: The app isn't authorized to schedule or receive notifications
-   `AUTHORIZED`: The app is authorized to schedule or receive notifications
-   `PROVISIONAL`: The app is provisionally authorized to post noninterruptive user notifications
-   `EPHEMERAL`: The app is authorized to schedule or receive notifications for a limited amount of time

## Notification events listeners

Notification events include incoming notifications, interactions your users perform with notifications (this can be tapping on a notification, or interacting with it via [notification categories](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#manage-notification-categories-interactive-notifications)), and rare occasions when your notifications may be dropped.

Several listeners are exposed and documented in the [Push notification behaviors](/push-notifications/what-you-need-to-know#push-notification-behaviors) section.

## Headless (Background) notifications

See the [definition](/push-notifications/what-you-need-to-know#headless-background-notifications) of Headless Background Notifications in the [What you need to know](/push-notifications/what-you-need-to-know) guide.

To handle notifications while the app is in the background or not running, you need to do the following:

-   Add `expo-task-manager` package to your project.
-   [Configure background notifications](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#background-notification-configuration).
-   In your application code, set up a [background task](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#registertaskasynctaskname) to run when the notification is received.

Then send a push notification which:

-   Contains only the `data` key (no `title`, `body`)
-   Has `_contentAvailable: true` set for iOS — see the [Expo push notification service payload format](/push-notifications/sending-notifications#message-request-format)

### Background notification configuration 

To be able to use headless (background) notifications push notifications on iOS, the `remote-notification` value needs to be present in the `UIBackgroundModes` array in your app's **Info.plist** file.

**If you're using [CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)**, set the [`enableBackgroundRemoteNotifications` property](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#configurable-properties) of the config plugin to true, and the correct configuration will be applied automatically by prebuild.

Configure UIBackgroundModes manually on iOS

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using a native iOS project, then you'll need to add the following to your **Expo.plist** file:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

## Additional information

### Set custom notification sounds

To add custom push notification sounds to your app, add the `expo-notifications` plugin to your **app.json** file and then under the `sounds` key, provide an array of local paths to sound files that can be used as custom notification sounds. These local paths are local to your project.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-notifications",
        {
          "sounds": ["local/path/to/mySoundFile.wav"]
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

After building your app, the array of files will be available for use in both [`NotificationContentInput`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#notificationcontentinput) and [`NotificationChannelInput`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#notificationchannelinput). You only need to provide the base filename. Here's an example using the config above:

```ts
await Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('new_emails', {
  name: 'E-mail notifications',
  importance: Notifications.AndroidImportance.HIGH,
  sound: 'mySoundFile.wav', // Provide ONLY the base filename
});

await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: "You've got mail! 📬",
    sound: 'mySoundFile.wav', // Provide ONLY the base filename
  },
  trigger: {
    type: Notifications.SchedulableTriggerInputTypes.TIME_INTERVAL,
    seconds: 2,
    channelId: 'new_emails',
  },
});
```

You can also manually add notification files to your Android and iOS projects if you prefer:

Manually adding notification sounds on Android

On Androids 8.0+, playing a custom sound for a notification requires more than setting the `sound` property on the `NotificationContentInput`. You will also need to configure the `NotificationChannel` with the appropriate `sound`, and use it when sending/scheduling the notification.

For the example below to work, you would place your **email_sound.wav** file in **android/app/src/main/res/raw/**.

```ts
// Prepare the notification channel
await Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('new_emails', {
  name: 'E-mail notifications',
  importance: Notifications.AndroidImportance.HIGH,
  sound: 'email_sound.wav', // <- for Android 8.0+, see channelId property below
});

// Eg. schedule the notification
await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: "You've got mail! 📬",
    body: 'Open the notification to read them all',
    sound: 'email_sound.wav', // <- for Android below 8.0
  },
  trigger: {
    type: Notifications.SchedulableTriggerInputTypes.TIME_INTERVAL,
    seconds: 2,
    channelId: 'new_emails', // <- for Android 8.0+, see definition above
  },
});
```
Manually adding notification sounds on iOS

On iOS, all that's needed is to place your sound file in your Xcode project (see the screenshot below), and then specify the sound file in your `NotificationContentInput`, like this:

```ts
await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: "You've got mail! 📬",
    body: 'Open the notification to read them all',
    sound: 'notification.wav',
  },
  trigger: {
    // ...
  },
});
```

### Push notification payload specification

See [Message request format](/push-notifications/sending-notifications#message-request-format).

### Manage notification categories for interactive notifications

Notification categories allow you to create interactive push notifications, so that a user can respond directly to the incoming notification either via buttons or a text response. A category defines the set of actions a user can take, and then those actions are applied to a notification by specifying the `categoryIdentifier` in the [`NotificationContent`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#notificationcontent).

On iOS, notification categories also allow you to customize your notifications further. With each category, not only can you set interactive actions a user can take, but you can also configure things like the placeholder text to display when the user disables notification previews for your app.

## Platform-specific guides

### Handling notification channels 

Starting in Android 8.0 (API level 26), all notifications must be assigned to a channel. For each channel, you can set the visual and auditory behavior that is applied to all notifications in that channel. Then, users can change these settings and decide which notification channels from your app should be intrusive or visible at all, as [Android developer docs](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/channels) states.

If you do not specify a notification channel, `expo-notifications` will create a fallback channel for you, named **Miscellaneous**. We encourage you to always ensure appropriate channels with informative names are set up for the application and to always send notifications to these channels.

> Calling these methods is a no-op for platforms that do not support this feature (Android below version 8.0 (26) and iOS).

### Custom notification icon and colors 

You can configure the `icon` and `color` keys for notification in the project by using the [`expo-notifications` config plugin](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#configurable-properties) with [Expo Prebuild](/workflow/prebuild). These are build-time settings, so you'll need to recompile your native Android app with `eas build -p android` or `npx expo run:android` to see the changes.

For your notification icon, make sure you follow [Google's design guidelines](https://material.io/design/iconography/product-icons.html#design-principles) (the icon must be all white with a transparent background) or else it may not be displayed as intended.

You can also set a custom notification color **per-notification** directly in your [`NotificationContentInput`](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#notificationcontentinput) under the `color` attribute.

## API

```js
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
```

## Fetch tokens for push notifications

### `addPushTokenListener(listener)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listener` | [PushTokenListener](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications#pushtokenlistenertoken) | A function accepting a push token as an argument, it will be called whenever the push token changes. |

  

In rare situations, a push token may be changed by the push notification service while the app is running. When a token is rolled, the old one becomes invalid and sending notifications to it will fail. A push token listener will let you handle this situation gracefully by registering the new token with your backend right away.

Returns: `EventSubscription`

An [`EventSubscription`](#eventsubscription) object represents the subscription of the provided listener.

Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

import { registerDevicePushTokenAsync } from '../api';

export default function App() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = Notifications.addPushTokenListener(registerDevicePushTokenAsync);
    return () => subscription.remove();
  }, []);

  return (
    // Your app content
  );
}
```

### `getDevicePushTokenAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Returns a native FCM, APNs token or a [`PushSubscription` data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushSubscription) that can be used with another push notification service.

Returns: `Promise<devicepushtoken>`

### `getExpoPushTokenAsync(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | [ExpoPushTokenOptions](#expopushtokenoptions) | Object allowing you to pass in push notification configuration. Default: `{}` |

  

Returns an Expo token that can be used to send a push notification to the device using Expo's push notifications service.

This method makes requests to the Expo's servers. It can get rejected in cases where the request itself fails (for example, due to the device being offline, experiencing a network timeout, or other HTTPS request failures). To provide offline support to your users, you should `try/catch` this method and implement retry logic to attempt to get the push token later, once the device is back online.

> For Expo's backend to be able to send notifications to your app, you will need to provide it with push notification keys. For more information, see [credentials](/push-notifications/push-notifications-setup#get-credentials-for-development-builds) in the push notifications setup.

Returns: `Promise<expopushtoken>`

Returns a `Promise` that resolves to an object representing acquired push token.

Example

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

export async function registerForPushNotificationsAsync(userId: string) {
  const expoPushToken = await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync({
   projectId: 'your-project-id',
  });

  await fetch('https://example.com/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      userId,
      expoPushToken,
    }),
  });
}
```

## Listen to notification events

### `addNotificationReceivedListener(listener)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listener` | (event: [Notification](#notification)) => void | A function accepting a notification ([`Notification`](#notification)) as an argument. |

  

Listeners registered by this method will be called whenever a notification is received while the app is running.

Returns: `EventSubscription`

An [`EventSubscription`](#eventsubscription) object represents the subscription of the provided listener.

Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

export default function App() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationReceivedListener(notification => {
      console.log(notification);
    });
    return () => subscription.remove();
  }, []);

  return (
    // Your app content
  );
}
```

### `addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(listener)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listener` | (event: [NotificationResponse](#notificationresponse)) => void | A function accepting notification response ([`NotificationResponse`](#notificationresponse)) as an argument. |

  

Listeners registered by this method will be called whenever a user interacts with a notification (for example, taps on it).

Returns: `EventSubscription`

An [`EventSubscription`](#eventsubscription) object represents the subscription of the provided listener.

Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Linking } from 'react-native';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

export default function Container() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(response => {
      const url = response.notification.request.content.data.url;
      Linking.openURL(url);
    });
    return () => subscription.remove();
  }, []);

  return (
    // Your app content
  );
}
```

### `addNotificationsDroppedListener(listener)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listener` | `() => void` | A callback function. |

  

Listeners registered by this method will be called whenever some notifications have been dropped by the server. Applicable only to Firebase Cloud Messaging which we use as a notifications service on Android. It corresponds to `onDeletedMessages()` callback. More information can be found in [Firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/receive#override-ondeletedmessages).

Returns: `EventSubscription`

An [`EventSubscription`](#eventsubscription) object represents the subscription of the provided listener.

### `useLastNotificationResponse()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

A React hook which returns the notification response that was received most recently (a notification response designates an interaction with a notification, such as tapping on it).

To clear the last notification response, use [`clearLastNotificationResponseAsync()`](#notificationsclearlastnotificationresponseasync).

> If you don't want to use a hook, you can use `Notifications.getLastNotificationResponseAsync()` instead.

Returns: `MaybeNotificationResponse`

The hook may return one of these three types/values:

-   `undefined` - until we're sure of what to return,
-   `null` - if no notification response has been received yet,
-   a [`NotificationResponse`](#notificationresponse) object - if a notification response was received.

Example

Responding to a notification tap by opening a URL that could be put into the notification's `data` (opening the URL is your responsibility and is not a part of the `expo-notifications` API):

```jsx
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
import { Linking } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  const lastNotificationResponse = Notifications.useLastNotificationResponse();
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (
      lastNotificationResponse &&
      lastNotificationResponse.notification.request.content.data.url &&
      lastNotificationResponse.actionIdentifier === Notifications.DEFAULT_ACTION_IDENTIFIER
    ) {
      Linking.openURL(lastNotificationResponse.notification.request.content.data.url);
    }
  }, [lastNotificationResponse]);
  return (
    // Your app content
  );
}
```

## Present incoming notifications when the app is running

### `setNotificationHandler(handler)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `handler` | [NotificationHandler](#notificationhandler) | null | A single parameter which should be either `null` (if you want to clear the handler) or a [`NotificationHandler`](#notificationhandler) object. |

  

When a notification is received while the app is running, using this function you can set a callback that will decide whether the notification should be shown to the user or not.

When a notification is received, `handleNotification` is called with the incoming notification as an argument. The function should respond with a behavior object within 3 seconds, otherwise, the notification will be discarded. If the notification is handled successfully, `handleSuccess` is called with the identifier of the notification, otherwise (or on timeout) `handleError` will be called.

The default behavior when the handler is not set or does not respond in time is not to show the notification.

Returns: `void`

Example

```jsx
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldShowBanner: true,
    shouldShowList: true,
    shouldPlaySound: false,
    shouldSetBadge: false,
  }),
});
```

## Run JavaScript in response to incoming notifications

### `registerTaskAsync(taskName)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `taskName` | `string` | The string you passed to `TaskManager.defineTask` as the `taskName` parameter. |

  

Call `registerTaskAsync` to set a callback (task) that runs when a notification is received while the app is in foreground, background, or terminated. Only on Android, the task also runs in response to a notification action tap when the app is backgrounded or terminated. When the app is terminated, only a [Headless Background Notification](/push-notifications/what-you-need-to-know#headless-background-notifications) triggers the task execution. However, the OS may decide not to deliver the notification to your app in some cases (e.g. when the device is in Doze mode on Android, or when you send too many notifications - Apple recommends to not ["send more than two or three per hour"](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/pushing-background-updates-to-your-app#overview)).

Under the hood, this function is run using `expo-task-manager`. You **must** define the task first, with [`TaskManager.defineTask`](/versions/latest/sdk/task-manager#taskmanagerdefinetasktaskname-taskexecutor) and register it with `registerTaskAsync`.

Make sure you define and register the task in the module scope of a JS module which is required early by your app (e.g. in the `index.ts` file) - see this [example](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/main/apps/notification-tester/index.ts#L2). `expo-task-manager` loads your app's JS bundle in the background and executes the task, as well as any side effects which may happen as a consequence of requiring any JS modules.

The callback function you define with `TaskManager.defineTask` receives an object with the following fields:

-   `data`: The remote payload delivered by either FCM (Android) or APNs (iOS). See [`NotificationTaskPayload`](#notificationtaskpayload) for details.
-   `executionInfo`: JSON object of additional info related to the task, including the `taskName`.
-   `error`: This field should always be undefined with a push-notification task.

From the callback function, you may return a [`BackgroundNotificationResult`](#backgroundnotificationresult) value to indicate the result of a background fetch operation on iOS.

Be advised that console.log statements may not be appropriate for debugging background tasks, as the output may not be visible depending on the platform and app state.

Returns: `Promise<null>`

Example

```ts
import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

const BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK = 'BACKGROUND-NOTIFICATION-TASK';

TaskManager.defineTask<Notifications.NotificationTaskPayload>(BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK, ({ data, executionInfo, error }) => {
  console.log('Received a notification task payload!');
  const isNotificationResponse = 'actionIdentifier' in data;
  if (isNotificationResponse) {
    // Do something with the notification response from user
  } else {
    // Do something with the data from notification that was received
  }
  return BackgroundNotificationResult.NoData
});

Notifications.registerTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK);
```

### `unregisterTaskAsync(taskName)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `taskName` | `string` | The string you passed to `registerTaskAsync` as the `taskName` parameter. |

  

Used to unregister tasks registered with `registerTaskAsync` method.

Returns: `Promise<null>`

## Fetch information about notifications-related permissions

### `getPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Calling this function checks current permissions settings related to notifications. It lets you verify whether the app is currently allowed to display alerts, play sounds, etc. There is no user-facing effect of calling this.

Returns: `Promise<notificationpermissionsstatus>`

It returns a `Promise` resolving to an object represents permission settings ([`NotificationPermissionsStatus`](#notificationpermissionsstatus)). On iOS, make sure you [properly interpret the permissions response](#interpret-the-ios-permissions-response).

Example

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

export async function allowsNotificationsAsync() {
  const settings = await Notifications.getPermissionsAsync();
  return (
    settings.granted || settings.ios?.status === Notifications.IosAuthorizationStatus.PROVISIONAL
  );
}
```

### `requestPermissionsAsync(permissions)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `permissions`(optional) | [NotificationPermissionsRequest](#notificationpermissionsrequest) | An object representing configuration for the request scope. |

  

Prompts the user for notification permissions according to request. **Request defaults to asking the user to allow displaying alerts, setting badge count and playing sounds**.

Returns: `Promise<notificationpermissionsstatus>`

It returns a Promise resolving to an object represents permission settings ([`NotificationPermissionsStatus`](#notificationpermissionsstatus)). On iOS, make sure you [properly interpret the permissions response](#interpret-the-ios-permissions-response).

Example

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

export function requestPermissionsAsync() {
  return Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync({
    ios: {
      allowAlert: true,
      allowBadge: true,
      allowSound: true,
    },
  });
}
```

## Manage application badge icon

### `getBadgeCountAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Fetches the number currently set as the badge of the app icon on device's home screen. A `0` value means that the badge is not displayed.

> **Note:** Not all Android launchers support application badges. If the launcher does not support icon badges, the method will always resolve to `0`.

Returns: `Promise<number>`

Returns a Promise resolving to a number that represents the current badge of the app icon.

### `setBadgeCountAsync(badgeCount, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `badgeCount` | `number` | The count which should appear on the badge. A value of `0` will clear the badge. |
| `options`(optional) | `SetBadgeCountOptions` | An object of options configuring behavior applied. |

  

Sets the badge of the app's icon to the specified number. Setting it to `0` clears the badge. On iOS, this method requires that you have requested the user's permission for `allowBadge` via [`requestPermissionsAsync`](#requestpermissionsasyncpermissions), otherwise it will automatically return `false`.

> **Note:** Not all Android launchers support application badges. If the launcher does not support icon badges, the method will resolve to `false`.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

It returns a Promise resolving to a boolean representing whether the setting of the badge succeeded.

| --- | --- |
| `token` | [DevicePushToken](#devicepushtoken) |

Returns:

`void`

### `SchedulableNotificationTriggerInput`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Literal Type: `union`

Input for time-based, schedulable triggers. For these triggers you can check the next trigger date with [`getNextTriggerDateAsync`](#getnexttriggerdateasynctrigger).

# Expo Pedometer

A library that provides access to the device's pedometer sensor.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

`Pedometer` from `expo-sensors` uses the system `hardware.Sensor` on Android and Core Motion on iOS to get the user's step count, and also allows you to subscribe to pedometer updates.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-sensors
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { Pedometer } from 'expo-sensors';

export default function App() {
  const [isPedometerAvailable, setIsPedometerAvailable] = useState('checking');
  const [pastStepCount, setPastStepCount] = useState(0);
  const [currentStepCount, setCurrentStepCount] = useState(0);

  const subscribe = async () => {
    const isAvailable = await Pedometer.isAvailableAsync();
    setIsPedometerAvailable(String(isAvailable));

    if (isAvailable) {
      const end = new Date();
      const start = new Date();
      start.setDate(end.getDate() - 1);

      const pastStepCountResult = await Pedometer.getStepCountAsync(start, end);
      if (pastStepCountResult) {
        setPastStepCount(pastStepCountResult.steps);
      }

      return Pedometer.watchStepCount(result => {
        setCurrentStepCount(result.steps);
      });
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = subscribe();
    return () => subscription && subscription.remove();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Pedometer.isAvailableAsync(): {isPedometerAvailable}</Text>
      <Text>Steps taken in the last 24 hours: {pastStepCount}</Text>
      <Text>Walk! And watch this go up: {currentStepCount}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    marginTop: 15,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

## API

```js
import { Pedometer } from 'expo-sensors';
```

## Methods

### `Pedometer.getPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Checks user's permissions for accessing pedometer.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

### `Pedometer.getStepCountAsync(start, end)`

Supported platforms: iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `start` | [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) | A date indicating the start of the range over which to measure steps. |
| `end` | [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) | A date indicating the end of the range over which to measure steps. |

  

Get the step count between two dates.

Returns: `Promise<pedometerresult>`

Returns a promise that fulfills with a [`PedometerResult`](#pedometerresult).

As [Apple documentation states](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmpedometer/1613946-querypedometerdatafromdate?language=objc):

> Only the past seven days worth of data is stored and available for you to retrieve. Specifying a start date that is more than seven days in the past returns only the available data.

### `Pedometer.isAvailableAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Returns whether the pedometer is enabled on the device.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

Returns a promise that fulfills with a `boolean`, indicating whether the pedometer is available on this device.

### `Pedometer.requestPermissionsAsync()`

## Methods

### `Print.printAsync(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `options` | [PrintOptions](#printoptions) | A map defining what should be printed. |

  

Prints a document or HTML, on web this prints the HTML from the page.

> Note: On iOS, printing from HTML source doesn't support local asset URLs (due to `WKWebView` limitations). As a workaround you can use inlined base64-encoded strings. See [this comment](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/7940#issuecomment-657111033) for more details.

> Note: on iOS, when printing without providing a `PrintOptions.printerUrl` the `Promise` will be resolved once printing is started in the native print window and rejected if the window is closed without starting the print. On Android the `Promise` will be resolved immediately after displaying the native print window and won't be rejected if the window is closed without starting the print.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

Resolves to an empty `Promise` if printing started.

### `Print.printToFileAsync(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |

On iOS, printing from HTML source doesn't support local asset URLs (due to `WKWebView` limitations). Instead, images need to be converted to base64 and inlined into the HTML.

```tsx
import { Asset } from 'expo-asset';
import { useImageManipulator } from 'expo-image-manipulator';
import { printAsync } from 'expo-print';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

const IMAGE = Asset.fromModule(require('@/assets/images/icon.png'));

export function ImageManipulatorExample() {
  const context = useImageManipulator(IMAGE.uri);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function generateAndPrint() {
      try {
        await IMAGE.downloadAsync();
        const manipulatedImage = await context.renderAsync();
        const result = await manipulatedImage.saveAsync({ base64: true });

        const html = `
          <html>
            <img
              src="data:image/png;base64,${result.base64}"
              style="width: 90vw;" />
          </html>
        `;

        await printAsync({ html });
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
      }
    }

    generateAndPrint();
  }, [context]);

  return <>{/* Render UI */}</>;
}
```

## Page margins

**On iOS** you can set the page margins using the `margins` option:

```js
const { uri } = await Print.printToFileAsync({
  html: 'This page is printed with margins',
  margins: {
    left: 20,
    top: 50,
    right: 20,
    bottom: 100,
  },
});
```

If `useMarkupFormatter` is set to `true`, setting margins may cause a blank page to appear at the end of your printout. To prevent this, make sure your HTML string is a well-formed document, including `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the beginning of the string.

**On Android**, if you're using `html` option in `printAsync` or `printToFileAsync`, the resulting print might contain page margins (it depends on the WebView engine). They are set by `@page` style block and you can override them in your HTML code:

```html
<style>
  @page {
    margin: 20px;
  }
</style>
```

See [`@page` documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@page) for more details.

# react-native-reanimated

A library that provides an API that greatly simplifies the process of creating smooth, powerful, and maintainable animations.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

[`react-native-reanimated`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started/) provides an API that greatly simplifies the process of creating smooth, powerful, and maintainable animations.

> **Reanimated uses React Native APIs that are incompatible with "Remote JS Debugging" for JavaScriptCore**. To use a debugger with your app with `react-native-reanimated`, you'll need to use the [Hermes JavaScript engine](/guides/using-hermes) and the [JavaScript Inspector for Hermes](/guides/using-hermes#javascript-inspector-for-hermes).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install react-native-reanimated react-native-worklets
```

  

No additional configuration is required. [Reanimated Babel plugin](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/glossary#reanimated-babel-plugin) is automatically configured in [`babel-preset-expo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-expo) when you install the library.

## Usage

The following example shows how to use the `react-native-reanimated` library to create a simple animation.

```jsx
import Animated, {
  useSharedValue,
  withTiming,
  useAnimatedStyle,
  Easing,
} from 'react-native-reanimated';
import { View, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function AnimatedStyleUpdateExample() {
  const randomWidth = useSharedValue(10);

  const config = {
    duration: 500,
    easing: Easing.bezier(0.5, 0.01, 0, 1),
  };

  const style = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
    return {
      width: withTiming(randomWidth.value, config),
    };
  });

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Animated.View style={[styles.box, style]} />
      <Button
        title="toggle"
        onPress={() => {
          randomWidth.value = Math.random() * 350;
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  box: {
    width: 100,
    height: 80,
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    margin: 30,
  },
});
```

Optional • Type: `boolean`

If true, the tab will be hidden from the tab bar.

> **Note**: Marking a tab as `hidden` means it cannot be navigated to in any way.

> **Note**: Dynamically hiding tabs will remount the navigator and the state will be reset.

### `listeners`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Literal type: `union`

Listeners for navigation events on this tab.

Supported events:

-   `tabPress` - called when this tab is pressed

# Expo Router Split View

An Expo Router submodule that provides native split view layout.
iOS

> SplitView is an alpha API available on **iOS only** in **Expo SDK 55** and later. The API is subject to breaking changes and is not ready for production usage yet.

`expo-router/unstable-split-view` is a submodule of `expo-router` and exports components to build split view layouts using [platform-native system split views](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/split-views).

> See the [Expo Router](/versions/latest/sdk/router) reference for more information about the file-based routing library for native and web app.

## Platform support

Split View is only available on iOS. On other platforms, the `SplitView` component automatically falls back to rendering as a standard `Slot` navigator, ensuring your app works across all platforms without conditional code.

## iPhone support

On iPhone, `SplitView` automatically collapses all columns into a single view. Only one column is visible at a time.

### Choosing the initial column

Use the `topColumnForCollapsing` prop to control which column is displayed when the split view is collapsed:

```tsx
<SplitView topColumnForCollapsing="primary">{/* ... */}</SplitView>
```

Accepted values are `primary`, `supplementary`, and `secondary`. When not set, the system uses its default behavior.

### Navigating between columns

Use a `ref` to programmatically show a specific column with the `show` method:

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { Pressable, Text } from 'react-native';
import { SplitView } from 'expo-router/unstable-split-view';
import type { SplitHostCommands } from 'react-native-screens/experimental';

export default function Layout() {
  const ref = useRef<SplitHostCommands>(null);

  return (
    <SplitView ref={ref} topColumnForCollapsing="primary">
      <SplitView.Column>
        <Pressable onPress={() => ref.current?.show('secondary')}>
          <Text>Show main content</Text>
        </Pressable>
      </SplitView.Column>
    </SplitView>
  );
}
```

## Known limitations

Cannot be nested

There can only be one `SplitView` in the navigation hierarchy. Attempting to nest split views will result in an error.

Cannot be used inside other navigators

`SplitView` cannot be used inside another navigator (except for `Slot`). It must be used at the root layout level.

Only specific children allowed

`SplitView` only accepts `SplitView.Column` and `SplitView.Inspector` as direct children. Other components will be ignored with a warning.

Header cannot be customized yet

The header (navigation bar) within split view columns cannot be customized. Custom header configurations are not yet supported.

Limited API

The current API surface is minimal and may not cover all use cases. Additional props and configuration options will be added in future releases.

Going back to previous column on iPhone

To go back to a previous column, tap the system back button in the navigation bar. A future release will add more granular programmatic control over back navigation.

> **Note:** We are actively developing `SplitView` and looking for feedback. You can share your thoughts on [Discord](https://chat.expo.dev), [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues), or use the **Feedback** button at the bottom of this page.

## Installation

To use `expo-router/unstable-split-view` in your project, you need to install `expo-router` in your project. Follow the instructions from Expo Router's installation guide:

[Install Expo Router](/router/installation) — Learn how to install Expo Router in your project.

## Using `SplitView.Column`

`SplitView.Column` defines additional columns in your split view layout. You can add up to two columns before the main content area.

### Two-column layout

A simple sidebar with main content:

```tsx
import { Link } from 'expo-router';
import { SplitView } from 'expo-router/unstable-split-view';
import { Text, Pressable } from 'react-native';
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-screens/experimental';

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <SplitView>
      <SplitView.Column>
        <SafeAreaView edges={{ left: true, top: true }} style={{ flex: 1 }}>
          <Link href="/inbox">
            <Pressable style={{ padding: 16 }}>
              <Text>Inbox</Text>
            </Pressable>
          </Link>
          <Link href="/sent">
            <Pressable style={{ padding: 16 }}>
              <Text>Sent</Text>
            </Pressable>
          </Link>
        </SafeAreaView>
      </SplitView.Column>
    </SplitView>
  );
}
```

### Three-column layout

A sidebar with supporting column and main content:

```tsx
import { Link, useGlobalSearchParams } from 'expo-router';
import { SplitView } from 'expo-router/unstable-split-view';
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-screens/experimental';

export default function Layout() {
  const params = useGlobalSearchParams();

  return (
    <SplitView>
      <SplitView.Column>
        <SafeAreaView
          edges={{ left: true, top: true }}
          style={{
            flex: 1,
            gap: 16,
            padding: 16,
          }}>
          <Link href="/?col1=1" style={{ fontWeight: params.col1 === '1' ? 'bold' : 'normal' }}>
            Option 1
          </Link>
          <Link href="/?col1=2" style={{ fontWeight: params.col1 === '2' ? 'bold' : 'normal' }}>
            Option 2
          </Link>
          <Link href="/?col1=3" style={{ fontWeight: params.col1 === '3' ? 'bold' : 'normal' }}>
            Option 3
          </Link>
        </SafeAreaView>
      </SplitView.Column>
      <SplitView.Column>
        <SafeAreaView
          edges={{ left: true, top: true }}
          style={{
            flex: 1,
            gap: 16,
            padding: 16,
          }}>
          <Link href={`/?col1=${params.col1}&col2=1`}>Sub-Option 1</Link>
          <Link href={`/?col1=${params.col1}&col2=2`}>Sub-Option 2</Link>
          <Link href={`/?col1=${params.col1}&col2=3`}>Sub-Option 3</Link>
        </SafeAreaView>
      </SplitView.Column>
    </SplitView>
  );
}
```

## Using `SplitView.Inspector`

`SplitView.Inspector` adds a supplementary column that slides in from the trailing edge, useful for showing additional details or metadata:

```tsx
<SplitView>
  <SplitView.Column>{/* Sidebar */}</SplitView.Column>
  <SplitView.Inspector>
    <View style={{ flex: 1, padding: 16 }}>
      <Text>Inspector Panel</Text>
    </View>
  </SplitView.Inspector>
</SplitView>
```

## Complete example

Here's a password manager-style app with three columns:

`app`

 `_layout.tsx`

 `index.tsx`

 `[type]`

  `[id].tsx`

  `index.tsx`

# Expo Router UI

An Expo Router submodule that provides headless tab components to create custom tab layouts.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-router/ui` is a submodule of `expo-router` library and exports components and hooks to build custom tab layouts, rather than using the default [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) navigators provided by `expo-router`.

> See the [Expo Router](/versions/latest/sdk/router) reference for more information about the file-based routing library for native and web app.

## Installation

To use `expo-router/ui` in your project, you need to install `expo-router` in your project. Follow the instructions from the Expo Router's installation guide:

[Install Expo Router](/router/installation) — Learn how to install Expo Router in your project.

## Configuration in app config

If you are using the [default](/more/create-expo#--template) template to create a new project, `expo-router`'s [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) is already configured in your app config.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": ["expo-router"]
  }
}
```

## Usage

For information about using `expo-router/ui` in Custom tab layouts guide:

[Custom tab layouts](/router/advanced/custom-tabs)

## API

```js
import { Tabs, TabList, TabTrigger, TabSlot } from 'expo-router/ui';
```

## Components

### `TabContext`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: React.[Element](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#function-component)<Context<[ExpoTabsNavigatorScreenOptions](#expotabsnavigatorscreenoptions)\>\>

### `TabList`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: React.[Element](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#function-component)<[TabListProps](#tablistprops)\>

Wrapper component for `TabTriggers`. `TabTriggers` within the `TabList` define the tabs.

Example

```tsx
<Tabs>
 <TabSlot />
 <TabList>
  <TabTrigger name="home" href="/" />
 </TabList>
</Tabs>
```

TabListProps

### `asChild`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `boolean`

Forward props to child component and removes the extra `<View>`. Useful for custom wrappers.

#### Inherited Props

-   [ViewProps](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#props)

### `Tabs`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: React.[Element](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#function-component)<[TabsProps](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/router-ui#tabsprops)\>

Root component for the headless tabs.

> **See:** [`useTabsWithChildren`](#usetabswithchildrenoptions) for a hook version of this component.

Example

```tsx
<Tabs>

### `TabTrigger`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: React.[Element](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#function-component)<[TabTriggerProps](#tabtriggerprops)\>

Creates a trigger to navigate to a tab. When used as child of `TabList`, its functionality slightly changes since the `href` prop is required, and the trigger also defines what routes are present in the `Tabs`.

When used outside of `TabList`, this component no longer requires an `href`.

Example

```tsx
<Tabs>
 <TabSlot />
 <TabList>
  <TabTrigger name="home" href="/" />
 </TabList>
</Tabs>
```

`expo-router` is a routing library for React Native and web apps. It enables navigation management using a file-based routing system and provides native navigation components and is built on top of [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/).

[Expo Router guides](/router/introduction) — Learn about Expo Router basics, navigation patterns, core concepts, and more.

## Installation

To use Expo Router in your project, you need to install. Follow the instructions from the Expo Router's installation guide:

[Install Expo Router](/router/installation) — Learn how to install Expo Router in your project.

## Configuration in app config

If you are using the [default](/more/create-expo#--template) template to create a new project, `expo-router`'s [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) is already configured in your app config.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": ["expo-router"]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `root` | `"app"` | Changes the routes directory from `app` to another value. Avoid using this property unless you have a specific need. |
| `origin` | `undefined` | Production origin URL where assets in the public folder are hosted. The fetch function is polyfilled to support relative requests from this origin in production. The development origin is inferred using the Expo CLI development server. |
| `headOrigin` | `undefined` | A more specific origin URL used in the `expo-router/head` module for iOS handoff. Defaults to `origin`. |
| `asyncRoutes` | `undefined` | Enable async routes (lazy loading). Can be a boolean, a string (`"development"` or `"production"`), or an object with platform-specific values (`{ android, ios, web, default }`). `production` is currently web-only and will be disabled on native. |
| `platformRoutes` | `true` | Enable or disable platform-specific routes (for example, **index.android.tsx** and **index.ios.tsx**). |
| `sitemap` | `true` | Enable or disable the automatically generated sitemap at **/_sitemap**. |
| `partialRouteTypes` | `true` | Enable partial typed routes generation. This allows TypeScript to provide type checking for routes without requiring all routes to be statically known. |
| `redirects` | `undefined` | An array of static redirect rules. Each rule should have `source`, `destination`, and optionally `permanent` (defaults to `false`) and `methods` (HTTP methods to redirect). |
| `rewrites` | `undefined` | An array of static rewrite rules. Each rule should have `source`, `destination`, and optionally `methods` (HTTP methods to rewrite). |
| `headers` | `undefined` | A list of headers that are set on every route response from the server. The value can be a string or an array of strings. |
| `disableSynchronousScreensUpdates` | `false` | Disable synchronous layout updates for native screens. This can help with performance in some cases. |
| `unstable_useServerMiddleware` | `false` | , Experimental. Enable server middleware support with a `+middleware.ts` file. Requires `web.output: "server"` to be set in app config. |
| `unstable_useServerDataLoaders` | `false` | , Experimental. Enable data loader support. This is only supported for `web.output: "static"` outputs at the moment. |
| `unstable_useServerRendering` | `false` | , Experimental. Enable server-side rendering. When enabled with `web.output: "server"`, HTML is rendered at request time instead of being pre-rendered at build time. |

## Usage

For information core concepts, notation patterns, navigation layouts, and common navigation patterns, start with Router 101 section:

## API

```js
import { Stack, Tabs, Link } from 'expo-router';
```

## Components

### `Link`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: React.[Element](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#function-component)<[LinkProps](#linkprops)\>

Component that renders a link using [`href`](#href) to another route. By default, it accepts children and wraps them in a `<Text>` component.

Uses an anchor tag (`<a>`) on web and performs a client-side navigation to preserve the state of the website and navigate faster. The web-only attributes such as `target`, `rel`, and `download` are supported and passed to the anchor tag on web. See [`WebAnchorProps`](#webanchorprops) for more details.

> **Note**: Client-side navigation works with both single-page apps, and [static-rendering](/router/reference/static-rendering).

Example

```tsx
import { Link } from 'expo-router';
import { View } from 'react-native';

export default function Route() {
 return (
  <View>
   <Link href="/about">About</Link>
  </View>
 );
}
```

LinkProps

### `asChild`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `boolean`

Used to customize the `Link` component. It will forward all props to the first child of the `Link`. Note that the child component must accept `onPress` or `onClick` props. The `href` and `role` are also passed to the child.

Example

```tsx
import { Link } from 'expo-router';
import { Pressable, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function Route() {
 return (
  <View>
   <Link href="/home" asChild>
     <Pressable>
      <Text>Home</Text>
     </Pressable>
   </Link>
  </View>
 );
}
```

### `className`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `string`

On native, this can be used with CSS interop tools like Nativewind. On web, this sets the HTML `class` directly.

### `dangerouslySingular`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: [SingularOptions](#singularoptions)

When navigating in a Stack, if the target is valid then screens in the history that matches the uniqueness constraint will be removed.

If used with `push`, the history will be filtered even if no navigation occurs.

### `dismissTo`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `boolean`

While in a stack, this will dismiss screens until the provided `href` is reached. If the href is not found, it will instead replace the current screen with the provided `href`.

Example

```tsx
import { Link } from 'expo-router';
import { View } from 'react-native';

export default function Route() {
 return (
  <View>
    <Link dismissTo href="/feed">Close modal</Link>
  </View>
 );
}
```

### `href`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Literal type: `union`

The path of the route to navigate to. It can either be:

-   **string**: A full path like `/profile/settings` or a relative path like `../settings`.
-   **object**: An object with a `pathname` and optional `params`. The `pathname` can be a full path like `/profile/settings` or a relative path like `../settings`. The params can be an object of key-value pairs.

Example

```tsx
import { Link } from 'expo-router';
import { View } from 'react-native';

export default function Route() {
 return (
  <View>
   <Link href="/about">About</Link>
   <Link
    href={{
      pathname: '/user/[id]',
      params: { id: 'bacon' }
    }}>
      View user
   </Link>
  </View>
 );
}
```

Acceptable values are: `string` | [HrefObject](#hrefobject)

### `onPress`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: (event: [MouseEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent)<[HTMLAnchorElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement), [MouseEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent)\> | GestureResponderEvent) => void

This function is called on press. Text intrinsically supports press handling with a default highlight state (which can be disabled with suppressHighlighting).

### `prefetch`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `boolean`

Prefetches the route when the component is rendered on a focused screen.

### `push`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `boolean`

Always pushes a new route, and never pops or replaces to existing route. You can push the current route multiple times or with new parameters.

Example

```tsx

      <Stack.SearchBar
        placeholder="Search..."

## Constants

### `Color`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Type: [ColorType](#colortype)

Color utility to access platform-specific colors easily.

On **Android**, it provides access to:

-   System colors, as a type-safe wrapper over `PlatformColor`. For example, `Color.android.background`.
-   Attribute colors, as a type-safe wrapper over `PlatformColor`. For example, `Color.android.attr.colorPrimary`.
-   [Material Design 3 static colors](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/static/baseline). For example, `Color.android.material.primary`.
-   [Material Design 3 dynamic colors](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/dynamic/user-generated-source). For example, `Color.android.dynamic.primary`.

On **iOS**, it is a type-safe wrapper over `PlatformColor`, providing access to system colors. For example, `Color.ios.label`.

> **Note**: To ensure the colors align with the system theme on Android, make sure they are used within a component that responds to theme changes, such as by using the `useColorScheme` hook from React Native. This is especially important when using React Compiler, which can memoize components.

Example

```tsx
import { Color } from 'expo-router';

Color.ios.label; // Access iOS system color
Color.android.background; // Access Android system color
Color.android.attr.colorPrimary; // Access Android attribute color
Color.android.material.primary; // Access Android Material Design 3 static color
Color.android.dynamic.primary; // Access Android Material Design 3 dynamic color
```

Example

```tsx
import { Color } from 'expo-router';
import { View, Text, useColorScheme } from 'react-native';

export default function MyComponent() {
  useColorScheme(); // Ensure the app responds to system theme changes
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: Color.android.dynamic.primary }}>
      <Text style={{ color: Color.android.dynamic.onPrimary }}>
        Hello, World!
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### `unstable_navigationEvents`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: `{ addListener: (eventType: EventType, callback: (event: Payload<EventType>) => void) => () => void, emit: (type: EventType, event: Payload<EventType>) => void, enable: () => void, isEnabled: () => boolean, saveCurrentPathname: () => void, }`

## Hooks

### `useFocusEffect(effect, do_not_pass_a_second_prop)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `effect` | [EffectCallback](#effectcallback) | Memoized callback containing the effect, should optionally return a cleanup function. |
| `do_not_pass_a_second_prop`(optional) | `undefined` | - |

  

Hook to run an effect whenever a route is **focused**. Similar to [`React.useEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect).

This can be used to perform side-effects such as fetching data or subscribing to events. The passed callback should be wrapped in [`React.useCallback`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback) to avoid running the effect too often.

Returns: `void`

Example

```tsx
import { useFocusEffect } from 'expo-router';
import { useCallback } from 'react';

export default function Route() {
  useFocusEffect(
    // Callback should be wrapped in `React.useCallback` to avoid running the effect too often.
    useCallback(() => {
      // Invoked whenever the route is focused.
      console.log("Hello, I'm focused!");

      // Return function is invoked whenever the route gets out of focus.
      return () => {
        console.log('This route is now unfocused.');
      };
    }, []),
   );

 return </>;
}
```

### `useGlobalSearchParams()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns URL parameters for globally selected route, including dynamic path segments. This function updates even when the route is not focused. Useful for analytics or other background operations that don't draw to the screen.

Route URL example: `acme://profile/baconbrix?extra=info`.

When querying search params in a stack, opt-towards using [`useLocalSearchParams`](#uselocalsearchparams) because it will only update when the route is focused.

> **Note:** For usage information, see [Local versus global search parameters](/router/reference/url-parameters#local-versus-global-url-parameters).

Returns: `RouteParams<troute> & TParams</troute>`

Example

```tsx
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import { useGlobalSearchParams } from 'expo-router';

export default function Route() {
  // user=baconbrix & extra=info
  const { user, extra } = useGlobalSearchParams();

  return <Text>User: {user}</Text>;
}
```

### `useIsPreview()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Hook to determine if the current route is rendered inside a preview.

Returns: `boolean`

-   True if the current route is rendered inside a preview, false otherwise.

### `useLoaderData()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns the result of the `loader` function for the calling route.

Returns: `LoaderFunctionResult<t>`

Example

```tsx
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import { useLoaderData } from 'expo-router';

export function loader() {
  return Promise.resolve({ foo: 'bar' }};
}

export default function Route() {
 const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>(); // { foo: 'bar' }

 return <Text>Data: {JSON.stringify(data)}</Text>;
}
```

### `useLocalSearchParams()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns the URL parameters for the contextually focused route. Useful for stacks where you may push a new screen that changes the query parameters. For dynamic routes, both the route parameters and the search parameters are returned.

Route URL example: `acme://profile/baconbrix?extra=info`.

To observe updates even when the invoking route is not focused, use [`useGlobalSearchParams`](#useglobalsearchparams).

> **Note:** For usage information, see [Local versus global search parameters](/router/reference/url-parameters#local-versus-global-url-parameters).

Returns: `RouteParams<troute> & TParams</troute>`

Example

```tsx
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import { useLocalSearchParams } from 'expo-router';

export default function Route() {
 // user=baconbrix & extra=info
 const { user, extra } = useLocalSearchParams();

 return <Text>User: {user}</Text>;
}
```

### `useNavigation(parent)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `parent`(optional) | string | [HrefObject](#hrefobject) | Provide an absolute path such as `/(root)` to the parent route or a relative path like `. /. /` to the parent route. |

  

Returns the underlying React Navigation [`navigation` object](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-object) to imperatively access layout-specific functionality like `navigation.openDrawer()` in a [Drawer](/router/advanced/drawer) layout.

Returns: `T`

The navigation object for the current route.

> **See:** React Navigation documentation on [navigation dependent functions](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-object/#navigator-dependent-functions) for more information.

Example

```tsx
import { useNavigation } from 'expo-router';

export default function Route() {
  // Access the current navigation object for the current route.
  const navigation = useNavigation();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text onPress={() => {
        // Open the drawer view.
        navigation.openDrawer();
      }}>
        Open Drawer
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

When using nested layouts, you can access higher-order layouts by passing a secondary argument denoting the layout route. For example, `/menu/_layout.tsx` is nested inside `/app/orders/`, you can use `useNavigation('/orders/menu/')`.

Example

```tsx
import { useNavigation } from 'expo-router';

export default function MenuRoute() {
  const rootLayout = useNavigation('/');
  const ordersLayout = useNavigation('/orders');

  // Same as the default results of `useNavigation()` when invoked in this route.
  const parentLayout = useNavigation('/orders/menu');
}
```

If you attempt to access a layout that doesn't exist, an error such as `Could not find parent navigation with route "/non-existent"` is thrown.

### `useNavigationContainerRef()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns: `NavigationContainerRefWithCurrent<rootparamlist>`

The root `<NavigationContainer />` ref for the app. The `ref.current` may be `null` if the `<NavigationContainer />` hasn't mounted yet.

### `usePathname()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns the currently selected route location without search parameters. For example, `/acme?foo=bar` returns `/acme`. Segments will be normalized. For example, `/[id]?id=normal` becomes `/normal`.

Returns: `string`

Example

```tsx
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import { usePathname } from 'expo-router';

export default function Route() {
  // pathname = "/profile/baconbrix"
  const pathname = usePathname();

  return <Text>Pathname: {pathname}</Text>;
}
```

### `usePreventZoomTransitionDismissal(_options)`

Supported platforms: iOS.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `_options`(optional) | [UsePreventZoomTransitionDismissalOptions](#usepreventzoomtransitiondismissaloptions) |

  

Limits the screen area where interactive dismissal gestures are allowed for zoom transitions.

This hook must be called from the destination screen of a zoom transition (the screen you navigate to, not the source). It restricts where app users can start swipe gestures to dismiss the screen and return to the previous screen.

When a dismissal gesture starts inside the bounds, the screen can be dismissed. When a dismissal gesture starts outside the bounds, dismissal is blocked completely. Undefined coordinates place no restriction on that dimension.

> **Note**: Only one instance of this hook should be used per screen. If multiple instances exist, the last one to render will take effect.

Returns: `void`

Example

```tsx
// In your destination screen (e.g., app/image.tsx)
import { usePreventZoomTransitionDismissal } from 'expo-router';
import { useWindowDimensions } from 'react-native';
import { Image } from 'expo-image';

export default function ImageScreen() {
  const dimensions = useWindowDimensions();
  // Only allow dismissal from the bottom 200px of the screen
  usePreventZoomTransitionDismissal({
    unstable_dismissalBoundsRect: {
      minY: dimensions.height - 200
    }
  });

  return <Image source={...} style={{ flex: 1 }} />;
}
```

> **Deprecated:** Use [`useNavigationContainerRef`](#usenavigationcontainerref) instead, which returns a React `ref`.

### `useRootNavigation()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns: `NavigationContainerRef<rootparamlist> | null</rootparamlist>`

### `useRootNavigationState()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns the [navigation state](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-state/) of the navigator which contains the current screen.

Returns: `Readonly<undefined>`

Example

```tsx
import { useRootNavigationState } from 'expo-router';

export default function Route() {
 const { routes } = useRootNavigationState();

 return <Text>{routes[0].name}</Text>;
}
```

### `useRouter()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns the [Router](#router) object for imperative navigation.

Returns: `Router`

Example

```tsx
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';
import { Text } from 'react-native';

export default function Route() {
 const router = useRouter();

 return (
  <Text onPress={() => router.push('/home')}>Go Home</Text>
 );
}
```

### `useSegments()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns a list of selected file segments for the currently selected route. Segments are not normalized, so they will be the same as the file path. For example, `/[id]?id=normal` becomes `["[id]"]`.

Returns: `RouteSegments<tsegments>`

Example

```tsx
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import { useSegments } from 'expo-router';

export default function Route() {
  // segments = ["profile", "[user]"]
  const segments = useSegments();

  return <Text>Hello</Text>;
}
```

`useSegments` can be typed using an abstract. Consider the following file structure:

```md
- app
  - [user]
    - index.tsx
    - followers.tsx
  - settings.tsx
```

This can be strictly typed using the following abstract with `useSegments` hook:

```tsx
const [first, second] = useSegments<['settings'] | ['[user]'] | ['[user]', 'followers']>()
```

### `useSitemap()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns: `SitemapType | null`

## Methods

### `Sitemap()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Returns: `Element`

### `withLayoutContext(Nav, processor, useOnlyUserDefinedScreens)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Nav` | `T` | The navigator component to wrap. |
| `processor`(optional) | (options: [ScreenProps[]](#screenprops)) => [ScreenProps[]](#screenprops) | A function that processes the screens before passing them to the navigator. |
| `useOnlyUserDefinedScreens`(optional) | `boolean` | If true, all screens not specified as navigator's children will be ignored. Default: `false` |

  

Returns a navigator that automatically injects matched routes and renders nothing when there are no children. Return type with `children` prop optional.

Enables use of other built-in React Navigation navigators and other navigators built with the React Navigation custom navigator API.

Returns: `Component<propswithoutref>> & { Protected: FunctionComponent, Screen: (props: ScreenProps) => null }</propswithoutref`

Example

```tsx
import { ParamListBase, TabNavigationState } from "@react-navigation/native";
import {
  createMaterialTopTabNavigator,
  MaterialTopTabNavigationOptions,
  MaterialTopTabNavigationEventMap,
} from "@react-navigation/material-top-tabs";
import { withLayoutContext } from "expo-router";

const MaterialTopTabs = createMaterialTopTabNavigator();

const ExpoRouterMaterialTopTabs = withLayoutContext<
  MaterialTopTabNavigationOptions,
  typeof MaterialTopTabs.Navigator,
  TabNavigationState<ParamListBase>,
  MaterialTopTabNavigationEventMap
>(MaterialTopTabs.Navigator);

export default function TabLayout() {
  return <ExpoRouterMaterialTopTabs />;
}
```

### `EffectCallback()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Memoized callback containing the effect, should optionally return a cleanup function.

Returns:

`undefined | void | () => void`

### `ExternalPathString`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Literal Type: `union`

Acceptable values are: `{string}:{string}` | `//{string}`

### `Href<T>`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

The main routing type for Expo Router. It includes all available routes with strongly typed parameters. It can either be:

-   **string**: A full path like `/profile/settings` or a relative path like `../settings`.
-   **object**: An object with a `pathname` and optional `params`. The `pathname` can be a full path like `/profile/settings` or a relative path like `../settings`. The params can be an object of key-value pairs.

An Href can either be a string or an object.

Generic: `T`

Type: T ? T[href] : string | [HrefObject](#hrefobject)

### `HrefObject`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| params(optional) | `UnknownInputParams` | Optional parameters for the route. |
| pathname | `string` | The path of the route. |

### `NativeIntent`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Created by using a special file called `+native-intent.tsx` at the top-level of your project's **app** directory. It exports `redirectSystemPath` or `legacy_subscribe` functions, both methods designed to handle URL/path processing.

Useful for re-writing URLs to correctly target a route when unique/referred URLs are incoming from third-party providers or stale URLs from previous versions.

> **See:** For more information on how to use `NativeIntent`, see [Customizing links](/router/advanced/native-intent).

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| legacy_subscribe(optional) | `(listener: (url: string) => void) => undefined | void | () => void` | Useful as an alternative API when a third-party provider doesn't support Expo Router but has support for React Navigation via `Linking.subscribe()` for existing projects. Using this API is not recommended for newer projects or integrations since it is incompatible with Server Side Routing and [Static Rendering](/router/reference/static-rendering), and can become challenging to manage while offline or in a low network environment. |
| redirectSystemPath(optional) | (event: { initial: boolean, path: string }) => [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<string | null\> | string | null | A special method used to process URLs in native apps. When invoked, it receives an `options` object with the following properties:
-   **path**: represents the URL or path undergoing processing.
-   **initial**: a boolean indicating whether the path is the app's initial URL.

. Its return value should be a `string`, a `Promise<string | null>`, or `null`. When a falsy value is returned (for example, `null`), no redirection occurs and the app stays on the current path. Note that throwing errors within this method may result in app crashes. It's recommended to wrap your code inside a `try/catch` block and utilize `.catch()` when appropriate.See: For usage information, see Redirecting system paths. |

### `PickPartial`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Literal Type: `union`

The list of input keys will become optional, everything else will remain the same.

Acceptable values are: [Omit](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#omittype-keys)<T, K\> | [Partial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#partialtype)<[Pick](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#picktype-keys)<T, K\>\>

### `WebAnchorProps`

Supported platforms: Web.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| download(optional) | `string` | Specifies that the [`href`](#href) should be downloaded when the user clicks on the link, instead of navigating to it. It is typically used for links that point to files that the user should download, such as PDFs, images, documents, and more. The value of the `download` property, which represents the filename for the downloaded file. This property is passed to the underlying anchor (`<a>`) tag. . Example
```jsx
<Link href="/image.jpg" download="my-image.jpg">Download image</Link>
```

 |
| rel(optional) | `string` | Specifies the relationship between the [`href`](#href) and the current route. Common values:

-   **nofollow**: Indicates to search engines that they should not follow the `href`. This is often used for user-generated content or links that should not influence search engine rankings.
-   **noopener**: Suggests that the `href` should not have access to the opening window's `window.opener` object, which is a security measure to prevent potentially harmful behavior in cases of links that open new tabs or windows.
-   **noreferrer**: Requests that the browser does not send the `Referer` HTTP header when navigating to the `href`. This can enhance user privacy.

. The `rel` property is primarily used for informational and instructive purposes, helping browsers and web crawlers make better decisions about how to handle and interpret the links on a web page. It is important to use appropriate `rel` values to ensure that links behave as intended and adhere to best practices for web development and SEO (Search Engine Optimization). This property is passed to the underlying anchor (`<a>`) tag. . Example

```jsx
<Link href="https://expo.dev" rel="nofollow">Go to Expo</Link>
```

 |
| target(optional) | `'_self' | '_blank' | '_parent' | '_top' | string & object` | Specifies where to open the [`href`](#href).

-   **_self**: the current tab.
-   **_blank**: opens in a new tab or window.
-   **_parent**: opens in the parent browsing context. If no parent, defaults to **_self**.
-   **_top**: opens in the highest browsing context ancestor. If no ancestors, defaults to **_self**.

. This property is passed to the underlying anchor (`<a>`) tag. Default: `'_self'`. Example

```jsx
<Link href="https://expo.dev" target="_blank">Go to Expo in new tab</Link>
```

# react-native-safe-area-context

A library with a flexible API for accessing the device's safe area inset information.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`react-native-safe-area-context` provides a flexible API for accessing device safe area inset information. This allows you to position your content appropriately around notches, status bars, home indicators, and other such device and operating system interface elements. It also provides a `SafeAreaView` component that you can use in place of `View` to automatically inset your views to account for safe areas.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install react-native-safe-area-context
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project. Then, follow the [installation instructions](https://appandflow.github.io/react-native-safe-area-context/) provided in the library's README or documentation.

## API

```js
import {
  SafeAreaView,
  SafeAreaProvider,
  SafeAreaInsetsContext,
  useSafeAreaInsets,
} from 'react-native-safe-area-context';
```

## Components

### `SafeAreaView`

`SafeAreaView` is a regular `View` component with the safe area edges applied as padding.

If you set your own padding on the view, it will be added to the padding from the safe area.

> If you are targeting web, you must set up `SafeAreaProvider` as described in the [Context](/versions/latest/sdk/safe-area-context#context) section.

```jsx
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <View />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```

SafeAreaView Props

### `edges`

Optional • Type: [`Edge[]`](#edge) • Default: `["top", "right", "bottom", "left"]`

  

Sets the edges to apply the safe area insets to.

### `emulateUnlessSupported`

Optional • Type: `boolean` • Default: `true`

  

On iOS 10+, emulate the safe area using the status bar height and home indicator sizes.

## Hooks

### `useSafeAreaInsets()`

Hook gives you direct access to the safe area insets. This is a more advanced use-case, and might perform worse than `SafeAreaView` when rotating the device.

Example

```jsx
import { useSafeAreaInsets } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function HookComponent() {
  const insets = useSafeAreaInsets();

  return <View style={{ paddingTop: insets.top }} />;
}
```

Returns

[`EdgeInsets`](/versions/latest/sdk/safe-area-context#edgeinsets)

## Types

### `Edge`

String union of possible edges.

Acceptable values are: `'top'`, `'right'`, `'bottom'`, `'left'`.

### `EdgeInsets`

Represent the hook result.

EdgeInsets Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bottom` | `number` | Value of bottom inset. |
| `left` | `number` | Value of left inset. |
| `right` | `number` | Value of right inset. |
| `top` | `number` | Value of top inset. |

## Guides

### Context

To use safe area context, you need to add `SafeAreaProvider` in your app root component.

> You may need to add it in other places too, including at the root of any modals any routes when using `react-native-screen`.

```jsx
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function App() {
  return <SafeAreaProvider>...</SafeAreaProvider>;
}
```

Then, you can use [`useSafeAreaInsets()`](/versions/latest/sdk/safe-area-context#usesafeareainsets) hook and also consumer API to access inset data:

```jsx
import { SafeAreaInsetsContext } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function Component() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaInsetsContext.Consumer>
      {insets => <View style={{ paddingTop: insets.top }} />}
    </SafeAreaInsetsContext.Consumer>
  );
}
```

### Optimization

If you can, use `SafeAreaView`. It's implemented natively so when rotating the device, there is no delay from the asynchronous bridge.

To speed up the initial render, you can import `initialWindowMetrics` from this package and set as the `initialMetrics` prop on the provider as described in Web SSR. You cannot do this if your provider remounts, or you are using `react-native-navigation`.

```jsx
import { SafeAreaProvider, initialWindowMetrics } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function App() {
  return <SafeAreaProvider initialMetrics={initialWindowMetrics}>...</SafeAreaProvider>;
}
```

### Web SSR

If you are doing server side rendering on the web, you can use `initialSafeAreaInsets` to inject values based on the device the user has, or simply pass zero. Otherwise, insets measurement will break rendering your page content since it is async.

### Migrating from CSS

#### Before

In a web-only app, you would use CSS environment variables to get the size of the screen's safe area insets.

```css
div {
  padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);
  padding-left: env(safe-area-inset-left);
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
  padding-right: env(safe-area-inset-right);
}
```

#### After

Universally, the hook `useSafeAreaInsets()` can provide access to this information.

```jsx
import { useSafeAreaInsets } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function App() {
  const insets = useSafeAreaInsets();
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        paddingTop: insets.top,
        paddingLeft: insets.left,
        paddingBottom: insets.bottom,
        paddingRight: insets.right,
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

# Expo ScreenCapture

A library that allows you to protect screens in your app from being captured or recorded.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

`expo-screen-capture` allows you to protect screens in your app from being captured or recorded, as well as be notified if a screenshot is taken while your app is foregrounded. The two most common reasons you may want to prevent screen capture are:

-   If a screen is displaying sensitive information (password, credit card data, and so on)
-   You are displaying paid content that you don't want to be recorded and shared

This is especially important on Android since the [`android.media.projection`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html#ScreenCapture) API allows third-party apps to perform screen capture or screen sharing (even if the app is in the background).

On Android, the screen capture callback works without additional permissions only for Android 14+. **You don't need to request or check permissions for blocking screen capture or using the callback on Android 14+.**

If you want to use the screen capture callback on Android 13 or lower, you need to add the `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` permission to your **AndroidManifest.xml** file. You can use the `android.permissions` key in your app config. See [Android permissions](/guides/permissions#android) for more information.

> The `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` permission can be added only for apps needing broad access to photos. See [Details on Google Play's Photo and Video Permissions policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/14115180).

> For testing screen capture functionality: On Android Emulator, run `adb shell input keyevent 120` in a separate terminal to trigger a screenshot. On iOS Simulator, you can trigger screenshots using **Device** > **Trigger Screenshot** from the menu bar.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-screen-capture
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Example: hook

```jsx
import { usePreventScreenCapture } from 'expo-screen-capture';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function ScreenCaptureExample() {
  usePreventScreenCapture();

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      <Text>As long as this component is mounted, this screen is unrecordable!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Example: Blocking screen capture imperatively

```jsx
import * as ScreenCapture from 'expo-screen-capture';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { Button, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';

export default function ScreenCaptureExample() {
  const activate = async () => {
    await ScreenCapture.preventScreenCaptureAsync();
  };

  const deactivate = async () => {
    await ScreenCapture.allowScreenCaptureAsync();
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Activate" onPress={activate} />
      <Button title="Deactivate" onPress={deactivate} />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

### Example: Callback for screen capture

```jsx
import * as ScreenCapture from 'expo-screen-capture';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { Button, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';

export default function useScreenCaptureCallback() {
  // Only use this if you add the READ_MEDIA_IMAGES permission to your AndroidManifest.xml
  const hasPermissions = async () => {
    const { status } = await ScreenCapture.requestPermissionsAsync();
    return status === 'granted';
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    let subscription;

    const addListenerAsync = async () => {
      if (await hasPermissions()) {
        subscription = ScreenCapture.addScreenshotListener(() => {
          alert('Thanks for screenshotting my beautiful app 😊');
        });
      } else {
        console.error('Permissions needed to subscribe to screenshot events are missing!');
      }
    };
    addListenerAsync();

    return () => {
      subscription?.remove();
    };
  }, []);
}
```

## API

```js
import * as ScreenCapture from 'expo-screen-capture';
```

## Hooks

### `usePermissions(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | `PermissionHookOptions<object>` |

  

Check or request permissions necessary for detecting when a screenshot is taken. This uses both [`requestPermissionsAsync`](#screencapturerequestpermissionsasync) and [`getPermissionsAsync`](#screencapturegetpermissionsasync) to interact with the permissions.

Returns: `[PermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<permissionresponse>, GetPermissionMethod]</permissionresponse>`

Example

```js
const [status, requestPermission] = ScreenCapture.usePermissions();
```

### `usePreventScreenCapture(key)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key`(optional) | `string` | If provided, this will prevent multiple instances of this hook or the `preventScreenCaptureAsync` and `allowScreenCaptureAsync` methods from conflicting with each other. This argument is useful if you have multiple active components using the `allowScreenCaptureAsync` hook. Default: `'default'` |

  

A React hook to prevent screen capturing for as long as the owner component is mounted.

Returns: `void`

### `useScreenshotListener(listener)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listener` | `() => void` | A function that will be called whenever a screenshot is detected. This hook automatically starts listening when the component mounts, and stops listening when the component unmounts. |

  

A React hook that listens for screenshots taken while the component is mounted.

Returns: `void`

## Methods

### `ScreenCapture.allowScreenCaptureAsync(key)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key`(optional) | `string` | This will prevent multiple instances of the `preventScreenCaptureAsync` and `allowScreenCaptureAsync` methods from conflicting with each other. If provided, the value must be the same as the key passed to `preventScreenCaptureAsync` in order to re-enable screen capturing. Default: `'default'` |

  

Re-allows the user to screen record or screenshot your app. If you haven't called `preventScreenCapture()` yet, this method does nothing.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `ScreenCapture.disableAppSwitcherProtectionAsync()`

Supported platforms: iOS.

Disables the privacy protection overlay that was previously enabled with `enableAppSwitcherProtectionAsync`.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `ScreenCapture.enableAppSwitcherProtectionAsync(blurIntensity)`

Supported platforms: iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blurIntensity`(optional) | `number` | The intensity of the blur effect, from 0.0 (no blur) to 1.0 (maximum blur). Default is 0.5. Default: `0.5` |

  

Enables a privacy protection blur overlay that hides sensitive content when the app is not in focus. The overlay applies a customizable blur effect when the app is in the app switcher, background, or during interruptions (calls, Siri, Control Center, etc.), and automatically removes it when the app becomes active again.

This provides visual privacy protection by preventing sensitive app content from being visible in:

-   App switcher previews
-   Background app snapshots
-   Screenshots taken during inactive states

For Android, app switcher protection is automatically provided by `preventScreenCaptureAsync()` using the FLAG_SECURE window flag, which shows a blank screen in the recent apps preview.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `ScreenCapture.getPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Checks user's permissions for detecting when a screenshot is taken.

> Only Android requires additional permissions to detect screenshots. On iOS devices, this method will always resolve to a `granted` permission response.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

A promise that resolves to a [`PermissionResponse`](#permissionresponse) object.

### `ScreenCapture.isAvailableAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Returns whether the Screen Capture API is available on the current device.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

A promise that resolves to a `boolean` indicating whether the Screen Capture API is available on the current device.

### `ScreenCapture.preventScreenCaptureAsync(key)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key`(optional) | `string` | Optional. If provided, this will help prevent multiple instances of the `preventScreenCaptureAsync` and `allowScreenCaptureAsync` methods (and `usePreventScreenCapture` hook) from conflicting with each other. When using multiple keys, you'll have to re-allow each one in order to re-enable screen capturing. Default: `'default'` |

  

Prevents screenshots and screen recordings until `allowScreenCaptureAsync` is called or the app is restarted. If you are already preventing screen capture, this method does nothing (unless you pass a new and unique `key`).

> On iOS, this prevents screen recordings and screenshots, and is only available on iOS 11+ (recordings) and iOS 13+ (screenshots). On older iOS versions, this method does nothing.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `ScreenCapture.requestPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Asks the user to grant permissions necessary for detecting when a screenshot is taken.

> Only Android requires additional permissions to detect screenshots. On iOS devices, this method will always resolve to a `granted` permission response.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

A promise that resolves to a [`PermissionResponse`](#permissionresponse) object.

## Event Subscriptions

### `ScreenCapture.addScreenshotListener(listener)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listener` | `() => void` | The function that will be executed when the user takes a screenshot. This function accepts no arguments. |

  

Adds a listener that will fire whenever the user takes a screenshot while the app is foregrounded.

Permission requirements for this method depend on your device’s Android version:

-   **Before Android 13**: Requires `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`.
-   **Android 13**: Switches to `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`.

# Expo ScreenOrientation

A universal library for managing a device's screen orientation.
Android, iOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

Screen Orientation is defined as the orientation in which graphics are painted on the device. For example, the figure below has a device in a vertical and horizontal physical orientation, but a portrait screen orientation. For physical device orientation, see the orientation section of [Device Motion](/versions/latest/sdk/devicemotion).

On both Android and iOS platforms, changes to the screen orientation will override any system settings or user preferences. On Android, it is possible to change the screen orientation while taking the user's preferred orientation into account. On iOS, user and system settings are not accessible by the application and any changes to the screen orientation will override existing settings.

> Web has [limited support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=deviceorientation).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-screen-orientation
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

### Warning

Apple added support for _split view_ mode to iPads in iOS 9. This changed how the screen orientation is handled by the system. To put the matter shortly, for iOS, your iPad is always in landscape mode unless you open two applications side by side. To be able to lock screen orientation using this module you will need to disable support for this feature. For more information about the _split view_ mode, check out [the official Apple documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207582).

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-screen-orientation` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "requireFullScreen": true
    },
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-screen-orientation",
        {
          "initialOrientation": "DEFAULT"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `initialOrientation` | `undefined` | Only for: iOS. Sets the iOS initial screen orientation. Possible values: `DEFAULT`, `ALL`, `PORTRAIT`, `PORTRAIT_UP`, `PORTRAIT_DOWN`, `LANDSCAPE`, `LANDSCAPE_LEFT`, `LANDSCAPE_RIGHT` |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

1.  Open the **ios** directory in Xcode with `xed ios`. If you don't have the directory, run `npx expo prebuild -p ios` to generate one.
2.  Tick the `Requires Full Screen` checkbox in Xcode. It should be located under **Project Target** > **General** > **Deployment Info**.

# react-native-screens

A library that provides native primitives to represent screens for better operating system behavior and screen optimizations.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`react-native-screens` provides native primitives to represent screens instead of plain `<View>` components To better take advantage of operating system behavior and optimizations around screens. This capability is used by library authors and is unlikely to be used directly by most app developers. It also provides the native components needed for React Navigation's [`createNativeStackNavigator`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install react-native-screens
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project. Then, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens#installation) provided in the library's README or documentation.

# Expo SecureStore

A library that provides a way to encrypt and securely store key-value pairs locally on the device.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Included in Expo Go

`expo-secure-store` provides a way to encrypt and securely store key-value pairs locally on the device. Each Expo project has a separate storage system and has no access to the storage of other Expo projects.

**Large payloads can be rejected by the underlying platform. Historically, some iOS releases refused values above roughly 2048 bytes. Expo does not enforce a limit, so make sure to handle native errors if you plan to store very large strings.**

**The `requireAuthentication` option is not supported in Expo Go when biometric authentication is available due to a missing `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` key.**

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-secure-store
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-secure-store` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-secure-store",
        {
          "configureAndroidBackup": true,
          "faceIDPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your Face ID biometric data."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `configureAndroidBackup` | `true` | Only for: Android. A boolean indicating whether to configure automatic Android backup to work correctly with `expo-secure-store`. [Learn more](#android-auto-backup). |
| `faceIDPermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your Face ID biometric data."` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the [`NSFaceIDUsageDescription`](#ios) permission message. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

Add `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` key to **Info.plist**:

```xml
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your Face ID biometric data.</string>
```

## Platform value storage

### Android

On Android, values are stored in [`SharedPreferences`](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences), encrypted with [Android's Keystore system](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html).

### iOS

On iOS, values are stored using the [keychain services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services) as `kSecClassGenericPassword`. **Due to the underlying nature of iOS Keychain, data stored with `expo-secure-store` will persist across app uninstallations when the app is reinstalled with the same bundle ID.** This is an expected behavior of the iOS Keychain system and should be considered when designing your app's data handling. iOS has the additional option of being able to set the value's `kSecAttrAccessible` attribute, which controls when the value is available to be fetched.

## Data persistence

`expo-secure-store` is designed to provide a persistent data storage solution across app restarts and updates. However, it is important not to rely on it as a single source of truth for irreplaceable, critical data.

-   **On Android:** Data saved using `expo-secure-store` **will not be preserved upon app uninstallation**.
-   **On iOS:** Data saved using `expo-secure-store` **will persist across app uninstallations** if the app is reinstalled with the same bundle ID. This is due to how the iOS Keychain manages stored credentials. Keep in mind that this is not guaranteed and you should never rely on this implementation detail.

Additionally, any data protected with the `requireAuthentication` option set to `true` will become inaccessible if there are changes to the user's biometric settings, such as adding a new fingerprint.

#### Exempting encryption prompt

Apple App Store Connect prompts you to select the type of encryption algorithm your app implements. This is known as **Export Compliance Information**. It is asked when publishing the app or submitting for TestFlight.

When using `expo-secure-store`, you can set the [`ios.config.usesNonExemptEncryption`](/versions/latest/config/app#usesnonexemptencryption) property to `false` in the app config:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "config": {
        "usesNonExemptEncryption": false
      }
      ... 
    }
  }
}
```

Setting this property automatically handles the compliance information prompt.

## Android Auto Backup

[Android Auto Backup for Apps](https://developer.android.com/identity/data/autobackup) automatically backs up a user's data from apps that target and run on Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher.

The Auto Backup system has to be configured to exclude `expo-secure-store` shared preferences entries, as it's impossible to decrypt them after restoring the backup — app's entries are deleted from the Android Key Store when the app is uninstalled.

If your app doesn't have any custom backup configuration, `expo-secure-store` will automatically configure the Auto Backup system to ignore the `expo-secure-store` data.

If you are using your own Auto Backup configuration, you should exclude the `SecureStore` under the `sharedpref` domain and set the `configureAndroidBackup` to `false` in the [config plugin configuration](/versions/latest/sdk/securestore#example-appjson-with-config-plugin).

```xml
<!--  Auto Backup configuration for Android 12 and higher -->
<data-extraction-rules>
  <cloud-backup>
    <include domain="sharedpref" path="."/>
    <exclude domain="sharedpref" path="SecureStore"/>
  </cloud-backup>
  <device-transfer>
    <include domain="sharedpref" path="."/>
    <exclude domain="sharedpref" path="SecureStore"/>
  </device-transfer>
</data-extraction-rules>
```

```xml
<!--  Auto Backup configuration for Android 11 and lower -->
<full-backup-content>
  <include domain="sharedpref" path="."/>
  <exclude domain="sharedpref" path="SecureStore"/>
</full-backup-content>
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Text, View, StyleSheet, TextInput, Button } from 'react-native';
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store';

async function save(key, value) {
  await SecureStore.setItemAsync(key, value);

  let result = await SecureStore.getItemAsync(key);
  if (result) {
    alert("🔐 Here's your value 🔐 \n" + result);
  } else {
    alert('No values stored under that key.');
  }
}

export default function App() {
  const [key, onChangeKey] = useState('Your key here');
  const [value, onChangeValue] = useState('Your value here');

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>Save an item, and grab it later!</Text>

## API

```js
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store';
```

## Constants

### `SecureStore.AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: [KeychainAccessibilityConstant](#keychainaccessibilityconstant)

The data in the keychain item cannot be accessed after a restart until the device has been unlocked once by the user. This may be useful if you need to access the item when the phone is locked.

### `SecureStore.AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: [KeychainAccessibilityConstant](#keychainaccessibilityconstant)

Similar to `AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK`, except the entry is not migrated to a new device when restoring from a backup.

> **Deprecated:** Use an accessibility level that provides some user protection, such as `AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK`.

### `SecureStore.ALWAYS`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: [KeychainAccessibilityConstant](#keychainaccessibilityconstant)

The data in the keychain item can always be accessed regardless of whether the device is locked. This is the least secure option.

> **Deprecated:** Use an accessibility level that provides some user protection, such as `AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`.

### `SecureStore.ALWAYS_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: [KeychainAccessibilityConstant](#keychainaccessibilityconstant)

Similar to `ALWAYS`, except the entry is not migrated to a new device when restoring from a backup.

### `SecureStore.WHEN_PASSCODE_SET_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: [KeychainAccessibilityConstant](#keychainaccessibilityconstant)

Similar to `WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`, except the user must have set a passcode in order to store an entry. If the user removes their passcode, the entry will be deleted.

### `SecureStore.WHEN_UNLOCKED`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: [KeychainAccessibilityConstant](#keychainaccessibilityconstant)

The data in the keychain item can be accessed only while the device is unlocked by the user.

### `SecureStore.WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: [KeychainAccessibilityConstant](#keychainaccessibilityconstant)

Similar to `WHEN_UNLOCKED`, except the entry is not migrated to a new device when restoring from a backup.

## Methods

### `SecureStore.canUseBiometricAuthentication()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Checks if the value can be saved with `requireAuthentication` option enabled.

Returns: `boolean`

`true` if the device supports biometric authentication and the enrolled method is sufficiently secure. Otherwise, returns `false`. Always returns false on tvOS.

### `SecureStore.deleteItemAsync(key, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | `string` | The key that was used to store the associated value. |
| `options`(optional) | [SecureStoreOptions](#securestoreoptions) | An [`SecureStoreOptions`](#securestoreoptions) object. Default: `{}` |

  

Delete the value associated with the provided key.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A promise that rejects if the value can't be deleted.

### `SecureStore.getItem(key, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | `string` | The key that was used to store the associated value. |
| `options`(optional) | [SecureStoreOptions](#securestoreoptions) | An [`SecureStoreOptions`](#securestoreoptions) object. Default: `{}` |

  

Synchronously reads the stored value associated with the provided key.

> **Note:** This function blocks the JavaScript thread, so the application may not be interactive when reading a value with `requireAuthentication` option set to `true` until the user authenticates.

Returns: `string | null`

Previously stored value. It resolves with `null` if there is no entry for the given key or if the key has been invalidated.

### `SecureStore.getItemAsync(key, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | `string` | The key that was used to store the associated value. |

Reads the stored value associated with the provided key.

Returns: `Promise<string>`

A promise that resolves to the previously stored value. It resolves with `null` if there is no entry for the given key or if the key has been invalidated. It rejects if an error occurs while retrieving the value.

> Keys are invalidated by the system when biometrics change, such as adding a new fingerprint or changing the face profile used for face recognition. After a key has been invalidated, it becomes impossible to read its value. This only applies to values stored with `requireAuthentication` set to `true`.

### `SecureStore.isAvailableAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Returns whether the SecureStore API is enabled on the current device. This does not check the app permissions.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

Promise which fulfils with a `boolean`, indicating whether the SecureStore API is available on the current device. Currently, this resolves `true` on Android and iOS only.

### `SecureStore.setItem(key, value, options)`

Stores a key–value pair.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A promise that rejects if value cannot be stored on the device.

## Types

### `KeychainAccessibilityConstant`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: `number`

### `SecureStoreOptions`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| accessGroup(optional) | `string` | Supported platforms: iOS. Specifies the access group the stored entry belongs to.See: Apple's documentation on Sharing access to keychain items among a collection of apps. |
| authenticationPrompt(optional) | `string` | Custom message displayed to the user while `requireAuthentication` option is turned on. |
| keychainAccessible(optional) | [KeychainAccessibilityConstant](#keychainaccessibilityconstant) | Supported platforms: iOS. Specifies when the stored entry is accessible, using iOS's `kSecAttrAccessible` property. Default: `SecureStore.WHEN_UNLOCKED`See: Apple's documentation on keychain item accessibility. |
| keychainService(optional) | `string` | 
-   Android: Equivalent of the public/private key pair `Alias`.
-   iOS: The item's service, equivalent to [`kSecAttrService`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecattrservice/).

If the item is set with the keychainService option, it will be required to later fetch the value. |
| requireAuthentication(optional) | `boolean` | Option responsible for enabling the usage of the user authentication methods available on the device while accessing data stored in SecureStore.

-   Android: Equivalent to [`setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder#setUserAuthenticationRequired\(boolean\)) (requires API 23).
-   iOS: Equivalent to [`biometryCurrentSet`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secaccesscontrolcreateflags/2937192-biometrycurrentset). Complete functionality is unlocked only with a freshly generated key - this would not work in tandem with the `keychainService` value used for the others non-authenticated operations.

. This option works slightly differently across platforms: On Android, user authentication is required for all operations. On iOS, the user is prompted to authenticate only when reading or updating an existing value (not when creating a new one). Warning: This option is not supported in Expo Go when biometric authentication is available due to a missing NSFaceIDUsageDescription. In release builds or when using continuous native generation, make sure to use the `expo-secure-store` config plugin. Note: This library requires a real device for testing since emulators/simulators do not require biometric authentication when retrieving secrets, unlike real iOS devices. |

# @react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control

A React Native library that provides a component to render UISegmentedControl from iOS.
Android, iOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

It's like a fancy radio button, or in Apple's words: "A horizontal control that consists of multiple segments, each segment functioning as a discrete button" ([source](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisegmentedcontrol)). This component renders to a [`UISegmentedControl`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisegmentedcontrol) on iOS, and to faithful recreations of that control on Android and web (because no equivalent exists on those platforms' standard libraries).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project. Then, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control#getting-started) provided in the library's README or documentation.

## Permissions

### Android

Starting in Android 12 (API level 31), the system has a 200Hz limit for each sensor updates.

If you need an update interval greater than 200Hz, you must add the following permissions to your **app.json** inside the [`expo.android.permissions`](/versions/latest/config/app#permissions) array.

| Android Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `HIGH_SAMPLING_RATE_SENSORS` | Allows an app to access sensor data with a sampling rate greater than 200 Hz. |

# Expo Server

Server-side API and runtime for Expo Router projects.
Server

`expo-server` is a server-side API and runtime library for Expo Router. It provides helpers you can use in your Expo Router API routes or other server code, and contains adapters to run Expo Router server exports.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-server
```

To use `expo-server` in your project, you need to configure your Expo Router project to export in `server` mode. Follow the instructions from Expo Router's API Routes guide:

[API Routes](/router/web/api-routes) — Learn how to create server endpoints with Expo Router.

## Usage

`expo-server`'s runtime APIs can only be used in server-side code and give you access to the server-side runtime environment. The runtime API exposes functions that can be called within the async context of request handlers and give you information about the current request or schedule tasks that run concurrently to the incoming request.

### Accessing request metadata

```ts
import { origin, environment } from 'expo-server';

export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({
    isProduction: environment() == null,
    isStaging: environment() === 'staging',
    origin: origin(),
  });
}
```

### Scheduling tasks

```ts
import { runTask, deferTask } from 'expo-server';

export async function GET() {
  runTask(async () => {
    console.log('will run immediately.');
  });

  deferTask(async () => {
    console.log('will run after the response resolved.');
  });

  return Response.json({ success: true });
}
```

## Adapters

`expo-server` exposes adapters to run Expo Router server-side exports in different environments or on different cloud provider serverless functions. Typically, every runtime needs its own adapter to function with the `expo-server` runtime. Before deploying to these providers, it is good to be familiar with the basics of [`npx expo export`](/more/expo-cli#exporting) command.

| Adapter | Provider |
| --- | --- |
| `expo-server/adapter/bun` | [Bun](https://bun.com/docs) |
| `expo-server/adapter/express` | [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html) |
| `expo-server/adapter/http` | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) |
| `expo-server/adapter/netlify` | [Netlify Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/build/functions/overview/) |
| `expo-server/adapter/vercel` | [Vercel Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions) |
| `expo-server/adapter/workerd` | [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/) |

To learn how to host API routes on different third-party services, follow the instructions from Expo Router's API Routes guide:

[API Routes](/router/web/api-routes#hosting-on-third-party-services) — Learn how to host API Routes on third-party services.

By convention, all adapters export a `createRequestHandler` function that accepts a parameters object. This accepts a `build` parameter that must be set to the relative path to the `dist/server` output directory that `npx expo export` created. Some adapters may also accept more values to configure the runtime API.

```ts
import path from 'node:path';
import { createRequestHandler } from 'expo-server/adapter/http';

const onRequest = createRequestHandler({
  build: path.join(process.cwd(), 'dist/server'),
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
});
```

## API

## Classes

### `StatusError`

Supported platforms: Server.

Type: Class extends [Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)

An error response representation which can be thrown anywhere in server-side code.

A `StatusError` can be thrown by a request handler and will be caught by the `expo-server` runtime and replaced by a `Response` with the `status` and `body` that's been passed to the `StatusError`.

Example

```ts
import { StatusError } from 'expo-server';

export function GET(request, { postId }) {
  if (!postId) {
    throw new StatusError(400, 'postId parameter is required');
  }
}
```

StatusError Properties

### `body`

Supported platforms: Server.

Type: `string`

### `status`

Supported platforms: Server.

Type: `number`

## Methods

### `deferTask(fn)`

Supported platforms: Server.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fn` | () => void | [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<unknown\> | A task function to execute after the request handler has finished. |

  

Defers a task until after a response has been sent.

This only calls the task function once the request handler has finished resolving a `Response` and keeps the request handler alive until the task is completed. This is useful to run non-critical tasks after the request handler, for example to log analytics datapoints. If the request handler rejects with an error, deferred tasks won't be executed.

Returns: `void`

### `environment()`

Supported platforms: Server.

Returns the request's environment, if the server runtime supports this.

In EAS Hosting, the returned environment name is the [alias or deployment identifier](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/hosting/deployments-and-aliases/), but the value may differ for other providers.

Returns: `string | null`

A request environment name, or `null` for production.

### `origin()`

Supported platforms: Server.

Returns the current request's URL.

This typically returns the request's URL, or on certain platform, the origin of the request. This does not use the `Origin` header in development as it may contain an untrusted value.

Returns: `string | null`

A request origin

### `requestHeaders()`

Supported platforms: Server.

Returns an immutable copy of the current request's headers.

Returns: `ImmutableHeaders`

### `runTask(fn)`

Supported platforms: Server.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fn` | () => [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<unknown\> | A task function to execute. The request handler will be kept alive until this task finishes. |

  

Runs a task immediately and instructs the runtime to complete the task.

A request handler may be terminated as soon as the client has finished the full `Response` and unhandled promise rejections may not be logged properly. To run tasks concurrently to a request handler and keep the request alive until the task is completed, pass a task function to `runTask` instead. The request handler will be kept alive until the task completes.

Returns: `void`

### `setResponseHeaders(updateHeaders)`

Supported platforms: Server.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `updateHeaders` | [Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) | Record<string, string | string[]\> | (headers: [Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers)) => void | [Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) | A `Headers` object, a record of headers, or a function that receives `Headers` to be updated or can return a `Headers` object that will be merged into the response headers. |

  

Sets headers on the `Response` the current request handler will return.

This only updates the headers once the request handler has finished and resolved a `Response`. It will either receive a set of `Headers` or an equivalent object containing headers, which will be merged into the response's headers once it's returned.

Returns: `void`

## Interfaces

### `ImmutableHeaders`

Supported platforms: Server.

Extends: `_ImmutableHeaders`

An immutable version of the Fetch API's `Headers` object. It cannot be mutated or modified.

### `ImmutableRequest`

Supported platforms: Server.

Extends: `_ImmutableRequest`

An immutable version of the Fetch API's `Request` object. It cannot be mutated or modified, its headers are immutable, and you won't have access to the request body.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| method | `string` | The **`method`** read-only property of the `POST`, etc.) A String indicating the method of the request. [MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request/method) |
| url | `string` | The **`url`** read-only property of the Request interface contains the URL of the request. [MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request/url) |

### `MiddlewareMatcher`

Supported platforms: Server.

Middleware matcher settings that restricts the middleware to run conditionally.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| methods(optional) | `string[]` | Set this to a list of HTTP methods to conditionally run middleware on. By default, middleware will match all HTTP methods. . Example. `['POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE']` |
| patterns(optional) | (string | [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp))[] | Set this to a list of path patterns to conditionally run middleware on. This may be exact paths, paths containing parameter or catch-all segments (`'/posts/[postId]'` or `'/blog/[. .slug]'`), or regular expressions matching paths. . Example. `['/api', '/posts/[id]', '/blog/[. .slug]']` |

# Expo Sharing

A library that provides functionality for sharing and receiving data from other apps.
Android, iOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-sharing` allows you to share files directly with other compatible applications and to receive compatible data shared from other apps.

#### Sharing limitations on web

-   `expo-sharing` for web is built on top of the Web Share API, which still has [very limited browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=web-share). Be sure to check that the API can be used before calling it by using `Sharing.isAvailableAsync()`.
-   **HTTPS required on web**: The Web Share API is only available on web when the page is served over https. Run your app with `npx expo start --tunnel` to enable it.
-   **No local file sharing on web**: Sharing local files by URI works on Android and iOS, but not on web. You cannot share local files on web by URI — you will need to upload them somewhere and share that URI.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-sharing
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-sharing` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

The following example shows a configuration that allows sharing a single or multiple images on Android and iOS:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-sharing",
        {
          "ios": {
            "enabled": true,
            "activationRule": {
              "supportsImageWithMaxCount": 5
            }
          },
          "android": {
            "enabled": true,
            "singleShareMimeTypes": ["image/*"],
            "multipleShareMimeTypes": ["image/*"]
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ios.enabled` | `false` | A boolean value to enable the iOS Share Extension. If `true`, a share extension target is added to the project. |
| `ios.extensionBundleIdentifier` | `{appBundleIdentifier}.ShareExtension` | The bundle identifier for the iOS Share Extension. |
| `ios.appGroupId` | `group.{appBundleIdentifier}` | The App Group ID to use for sharing data between the app and the extension. |
| `ios.activationRule` | `{}` | Configuration for the `NSExtensionActivationRule` in **Info.plist**. Can be either an object confirming to the [`ActivationRuleOptions`](#activationruleoptions) type to generate a standard predicate or a raw string to specify a custom predicate directly (for example, `SUBQUERY(. .)`). |
| `android.enabled` | `false` | A boolean value to enable Android share intent handling. If `true`, adds the necessary `intent-filter` to the **AndroidManifest.xml**. |
| `android.singleShareMimeTypes` | `[]` | An array of MIME types to accept for single file sharing (using `ACTION_SEND` intent). |
| `android.multipleShareMimeTypes` | `[]` | An array of MIME types to accept for multiple file sharing (using `ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE` intent). |

## Sharing to your app from other apps

> **Note**: This functionality is currently experimental. On iOS the share extension opens the main target, instead of processing the share in a sharing `ViewController`, which is not officially supported by Apple and may stop working in a future iOS release.

When an app user shares content with your app, the operating system launches your app (also known as the process of bringing it to the foreground). To process this action, you need to configure your navigation to handle the incoming deep link.

### Expo Router

If you are using [Expo Router](/router/introduction), you can use the [**+native-intent.ts**](/router/advanced/native-intent) file to handle the incoming share intent. This allows you to inspect the incoming path and redirect to a specific route.

```tsx
import { getSharedPayloads } from 'expo-sharing';

export async function redirectSystemPath({ path, initial }: { path: string; initial: boolean }) {
  try {
    // Check if the URL is from the share extension/intent
    if (new URL(path).hostname === 'expo-sharing') {
      return '/handle-share';
    }
    return path;
  } catch {
    // Fallback to the root path on error
    return '/';
  }
}
```

### React Navigation

If you are using [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/), you can use the `linking` prop to intercept the deep link. You should check if the incoming URL hostname matches the `expo-sharing` scheme and redirect the user to a specific handler screen.

```tsx
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';
import { createStaticNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';

const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
  screens: {
    // Other screens
    HandleShare: {
      screen: HandleShare,
      linking: {
        path: '/handle-share',
      },
    },
  },
});

const Navigation = createStaticNavigation(RootStack);

function processUrl(url: string | null) {
  if (!url) return null;

  // The path to your share handler screen
  const handlerUrl = Linking.createURL('/handle-share');

  // Check if the URL is from the share extension/intent
  if (new URL(url).hostname === 'expo-sharing') {
    return handlerUrl;
  }
  return url;
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Navigation
      // The rest of your navigation config
      linking={{
        prefixes: [Linking.createURL('/')],
        async getInitialURL() {
          const initialUrl = await Linking.getInitialURL();
          return processUrl(initialUrl);
        },
        subscribe(listener) {
          const linkingSubscription = Linking.addEventListener('url', ({ url }) => {
            const processedUrl = processUrl(url) ?? url;
            listener(processedUrl);
          });

          return () => {
            linkingSubscription.remove();
          };
        },
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### No navigation library

If you are creating a basic app without a navigation library, your main screen is the handler screen. You can move on to the next section.

## Displaying shared content

Once you have redirected the user to a handler screen, you can use the `useIncomingShare` hook to access and display the shared data.

The following example shows a screen that displays shared images:

```tsx
import { Image } from 'expo-image';
import { useIncomingShare } from 'expo-sharing';
import { View, StyleSheet, ActivityIndicator } from 'react-native';

export default function ShareReceived() {
  const { resolvedSharedPayloads, isResolving } = useIncomingShare();

  if (isResolving) {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <ActivityIndicator size="large" />
      </View>
    );
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {resolvedSharedPayloads.map((payload, index) => {
        if (payload.contentType === 'image') {
          return <Image source={{ uri: payload.contentUri }} style={styles.image} key={index} />;
        }
        return null;
      })}
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: 'white',
  },
  image: {
    width: 300,
    height: 300,
    marginBottom: 20,
    borderRadius: 10,
  },
});
```

# Expo SMS

A library that provides access to the system's UI/app for sending SMS messages.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

`expo-sms` provides access to the system's UI/app for sending SMS messages.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-sms
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## API

```js
import * as SMS from 'expo-sms';
```

## Methods

### `SMS.isAvailableAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Determines whether SMS is available. Always returns `false` in the iOS simulator, and in browser.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

Returns a promise that fulfils with a `boolean`, indicating whether SMS is available on this device.

Example

```ts
const isAvailable = await SMS.isAvailableAsync();
if (isAvailable) {
  // do your SMS stuff here
} else {
  // misfortune... there's no SMS available on this device
}
```

### `SMS.sendSMSAsync(addresses, message, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `addresses` | `string | string[]` | An array of addresses (phone numbers) or single address passed as strings. Those would appear as recipients of the prepared message. |
| `message` | `string` | Message to be sent. |
| `options`(optional) | [SMSOptions](#smsoptions) | A `SMSOptions` object defining additional SMS configuration options. |

  

Opens the default UI/app for sending SMS messages with prefilled addresses and message.

Returns: `Promise<smsresponse>`

Returns a Promise that fulfils with the SMS action is invoked by the user, with corresponding result:

-   If the user cancelled the SMS sending process: `{ result: 'cancelled' }`.
-   If the user has sent/scheduled message for sending: `{ result: 'sent' }`.
-   If the status of the SMS message cannot be determined: `{ result: 'unknown' }`.

Android does not provide information about the status of the SMS message, so on Android devices the Promise will always resolve with `{ result: 'unknown' }`.

> Note: The only feedback collected by this module is whether any message has been sent. That means we do not check actual content of message nor recipients list.

Example

```ts
const { result } = await SMS.sendSMSAsync(
  ['0123456789', '9876543210'],
  'My sample HelloWorld message',
  {
    attachments: {

# Expo SplashScreen

A library that provides access to controlling the visibility behavior of native splash screen.
Android, iOS, tvOS

The `SplashScreen` module from the `expo-splash-screen` library provides control over the native splash screen behavior. By default, the splash screen will automatically hide when your app is ready, but you can also manually control its visibility for advanced use cases.

> From **SDK 52**, due to changes supporting the latest Android splash screen API, Expo Go and development builds cannot fully replicate the splash screen experience your users will see in your [standalone app](/more/glossary-of-terms#standalone-app). Expo Go will show your app icon instead of the splash screen, and the splash screen on development builds will not reflect all properties set in the config plugin. **It is highly recommended that you test your splash screen on a release build to ensure it looks as expected.**

Also, see the guide on [creating a splash screen image](/develop/user-interface/splash-screen-and-app-icon#splash-screen), or [quickly generate an icon and splash screen using your browser](https://buildicon.netlify.app/).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-splash-screen
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

For most apps, you don't need to do anything special with the splash screen. It will automatically hide when your app is ready. You can optionally configure animation options:

```tsx
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

// Set the animation options. This is optional.
SplashScreen.setOptions({
  duration: 1000,
  fade: true,
});

export default function RootLayout() {
  return <Stack />;
}
```

### Delay hiding the splash screen

In some cases, it may be necessary to delay hiding the splash screen until certain resources are loaded. For example, if you need to load API data before displaying the app content, you can use `preventAutoHideAsync()` to manually control when the splash screen hides. The goal should be to hide the splash screen as soon as possible.

```tsx
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

// Keep the splash screen visible while we fetch resources
SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();

export default function RootLayout() {
  const [isReady, setIsReady] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function doAsyncStuff() {
      try {
        // do something async here
      } catch (e) {
        console.warn(e);
      } finally {
        setIsReady(true);
      }
    }

    doAsyncStuff();
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isReady) {
      SplashScreen.hide();
    }
  }, [isReady]);

  if (!isReady) {
    return null;
  }

  return <Stack />;
}
```

## Configuration

You can configure `expo-splash-screen` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

**Using the config plugin, as shown below, is the recommended method for configuring the splash screen.** The other methods are now considered legacy and will be removed in the future.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-splash-screen",
        {
          "backgroundColor": "#232323",
          "image": "./assets/splash-icon.png",
          "dark": {
            "image": "./assets/splash-icon-dark.png",
            "backgroundColor": "#000000"
          },
          "imageWidth": 200
        }
      ]
    ],
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `backgroundColor` | `#ffffff` | A hex color string representing the background color of the splash screen. |
| `image` | `undefined` | The path to the image file that will be displayed on the splash screen. This should be your app icon or logo. |
| `enableFullScreenImage_legacy` | `false` | Only for: iOS. Enabling this property allows using a full screen image as the splashscreen. This is to help with the transition from the legacy splash screen configuration and will be removed in the future. |
| `dark` | `undefined` | An object containing properties for configuring the splash screen when the device is in dark mode. |
| `imageWidth` | `100` | The width to make the image. |
| `android` | `undefined` | An object containing properties for configuring the splash screen on Android. |
| `ios` | `undefined` | An object containing properties for configuring the splash screen on iOS. |
| `resizeMode` | `undefined` | Determines how the image is scaled to fit the container defined by `imageWidth`. Possible values: `contain`, `cover`, or `native`. |

You can also configure `expo-splash-screen`, using the following [app config](/workflow/configuration) properties but the config plugin should be preferred.

-   [`splash`](/versions/latest/config/app#splash)
-   [`android.splash`](/versions/latest/config/app#splash-2)
-   [`ios.splash`](/versions/latest/config/app#splash-1)

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

See how to configure the native projects in the [installation instructions in the `expo-splash-screen` repository](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-splash-screen#-installation-in-bare-react-native-projects).

### Animating the splash screen

`SplashScreen` provides an out-of-the-box fade animation. It can be configured using the `setOptions` method.

```tsx
SplashScreen.setOptions({
  duration: 1000,
  fade: true,
});
```

If you prefer to use custom animation, see the [`with-splash-screen`](https://github.com/expo/examples/tree/master/with-splash-screen) example on how to apply any arbitrary animations to your splash screen. You can initialize a new project from this example by running `npx create-expo-app --example with-splash-screen`.

## API

```tsx
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';
```

## Methods

### `SplashScreen.hide()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Hides the native splash screen immediately. Be careful to ensure that your app has content ready to display when you hide the splash screen, or you may see a blank screen briefly. See the ["Usage"](#usage) section for an example.

Returns: `void`

### `SplashScreen.hideAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Hides the native splash screen immediately. This method is provided for backwards compatability. See the ["Usage"](#usage) section for an example.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Makes the native splash screen (configured in `app.json`) remain visible until `hideAsync` is called.

> **Important note**: It is recommended to call this in global scope without awaiting, rather than inside React components or hooks, because otherwise this might be called too late, when the splash screen is already hidden.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

Example

```ts
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();

export default function App() {
 // ...
}
```

### `SplashScreen.setOptions(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options` | [SplashScreenOptions](#splashscreenoptions) |

  

Configures the splashscreens default animation behavior.

Returns: `void`

## Types

### `SplashScreenOptions`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| duration(optional) | `number` | The duration of the fade out animation in milliseconds. Default: `400` |
| fade(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: iOS. Whether to hide the splash screen with a fade out animation. Default: `false` |

# Expo SQLite

A library that provides access to a database that can be queried through a SQLite API.
Android, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-sqlite` gives your app access to a database that can be queried through a SQLite API. The database is persisted across restarts of your app.

> On Apple TV, the underlying database file is in the caches directory and not the application documents directory, per [Apple platform guidelines](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/react-native-tvos/issues/68#issuecomment-628327676).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-sqlite
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-sqlite` for advanced configurations using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-sqlite",
        {
          "enableFTS": true,
          "useSQLCipher": true,
          "android": {
            // Override the shared configuration for Android
            "enableFTS": false,
            "useSQLCipher": false
          },
          "ios": {
            // You can also override the shared configurations for iOS
            "customBuildFlags": ["-DSQLITE_ENABLE_DBSTAT_VTAB=1 -DSQLITE_ENABLE_SNAPSHOT=1"]
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `customBuildFlags` | - | Custom build flags to be passed to the SQLite build process. |
| `enableFTS` | `true` | Whether to enable the [FTS3, FTS4](https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html) and [FTS5](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html) extensions. |
| `useSQLCipher` | `false` | Use the [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) implementations rather than the default SQLite. |
| `useLibSQL` | `false` | Use [libSQL](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql) rather than the default SQLite. |
| `withSQLiteVecExtension` | `false` | Include the [sqlite-vec](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec) extension to [`bundledExtensions`](#sqlitebundledextensions). |

## Web setup

> Web support is in alpha and may be unstable. [Create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues) if you encounter any issues.

To use `expo-sqlite` on web, you need to configure Metro bundler to support **wasm** files and add HTTP headers to allow [`SharedArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer) usage.

Add the following configuration to your **metro.config.js**. If you don't have the **metro.config.js** yet, you can run `npx expo customize metro.config.js`. [Learn more](/guides/customizing-metro).

If you deploy your app to web hosting services, you will also need to add the `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` and `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` headers to your web server. [Learn more about the `COEP`, `COOP` headers, and `SharedArrayBuffer`](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/enabling-shared-array-buffer/).

If you deploy your app on [EAS Hosting](/eas/hosting/introduction), you can configure the headers in your app config:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-router",
        {
          "headers": {
            "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy": "credentialless",
            "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy": "same-origin"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

## Usage

Import the module from `expo-sqlite`.

```js
import * as SQLite from 'expo-sqlite';
```

### Basic CRUD operations

```js
const db = await SQLite.openDatabaseAsync('databaseName');

### Prepared statements

Prepared statements allow you to compile your SQL query once and execute it multiple times with different parameters. They automatically escape input parameters to defend against SQL injection attacks, and are recommended for queries that include user input. You can get a prepared statement by calling [`prepareAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#prepareasyncsource) or [`prepareSync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#preparesyncsource) method on a database instance. The prepared statement can fulfill CRUD operations by calling [`executeAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#executeasyncparams) or [`executeSync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#executesyncparams) method.

> **Note:** Remember to call [`finalizeAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#finalizeasync) or [`finalizeSync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#finalizesync) method to release the prepared statement after you finish using the statement. `try-finally` block is recommended to ensure the prepared statement is finalized.

```ts
const statement = await db.prepareAsync(
  'INSERT INTO test (value, intValue) VALUES ($value, $intValue)'
);
try {
  let result = await statement.executeAsync({ $value: 'bbb', $intValue: 101 });
  console.log('bbb and 101:', result.lastInsertRowId, result.changes);

  result = await statement.executeAsync({ $value: 'ccc', $intValue: 102 });
  console.log('ccc and 102:', result.lastInsertRowId, result.changes);

  result = await statement.executeAsync({ $value: 'ddd', $intValue: 103 });
  console.log('ddd and 103:', result.lastInsertRowId, result.changes);
} finally {
  await statement.finalizeAsync();
}

const statement2 = await db.prepareAsync('SELECT * FROM test WHERE intValue >= $intValue');
try {
  const result = await statement2.executeAsync<{ value: string; intValue: number }>({
    $intValue: 100,
  });

  // `getFirstAsync()` is useful when you want to get a single row from the database.
  const firstRow = await result.getFirstAsync();
  console.log(firstRow.id, firstRow.value, firstRow.intValue);

  // Reset the SQLite query cursor to the beginning for the next `getAllAsync()` call.
  await result.resetAsync();

  // `getAllAsync()` is useful when you want to get all results as an array of objects.
  const allRows = await result.getAllAsync();
  for (const row of allRows) {
    console.log(row.value, row.intValue);
  }

  // Reset the SQLite query cursor to the beginning for the next `for-await-of` loop.
  await result.resetAsync();

  // The result object is also an async iterable. You can use it in `for-await-of` loop to iterate SQLite query cursor.
  for await (const row of result) {
    console.log(row.value, row.intValue);
  }
} finally {
  await statement2.finalizeAsync();
}
```

### Tagged template literals API

For convenience and improved developer experience, `expo-sqlite` provides Bun-inspired tagged template literals API through the `db.sql` property. This API automatically escapes parameters to prevent SQL injection attacks and provides automatic type inference based on the query type.

```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const db = await SQLite.openDatabaseAsync('mydb.db');
const sql = db.sql;

const age = 21;
const users = await sql<User>`SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ${age}`;
// Type: User[]
console.log(users[0].name);

// Mutable queries like INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE return SQLiteRunResult metadata
const result =
  (await sql`INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (${'Alice'}, ${30})`) as SQLite.SQLiteRunResult;
console.log(result.lastInsertRowId, result.changes);

// Get first row only
const user = await sql<User>`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${1}`.first();
if (user) {
  console.log(user.name);
}

// Iterate over results
for await (const user of sql<User>`SELECT * FROM users`.each()) {
  console.log(user.name);
}

// Synchronous API
const syncUsers = sql<User>`SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ${21}`.allSync();
const syncUser = sql<User>`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${1}`.firstSync();
```

### `useSQLiteContext()` hook

```tsx
import { SQLiteProvider, useSQLiteContext, type SQLiteDatabase } from 'expo-sqlite';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <SQLiteProvider databaseName="test.db" onInit={migrateDbIfNeeded}>
        <Header />
        <Content />
      </SQLiteProvider>
    </View>
  );
}

export function Header() {
  const db = useSQLiteContext();
  const [version, setVersion] = useState('');
  useEffect(() => {
    async function setup() {
      const result = await db.getFirstAsync<{ 'sqlite_version()': string }>(
        'SELECT sqlite_version()'
      );
      setVersion(result['sqlite_version()']);
    }
    setup();
  }, []);
  return (
    <View style={styles.headerContainer}>
      <Text style={styles.headerText}>SQLite version: {version}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

interface Todo {
  value: string;
  intValue: number;
}

export function Content() {
  const db = useSQLiteContext();
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Todo[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function setup() {
      const result = await db.getAllAsync<Todo>('SELECT * FROM todos');
      setTodos(result);
    }
    setup();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.contentContainer}>
      {todos.map((todo, index) => (
        <View style={styles.todoItemContainer} key={index}>
          <Text>{`${todo.intValue} - ${todo.value}`}</Text>
        </View>
      ))}
    </View>
  );
}

async function migrateDbIfNeeded(db: SQLiteDatabase) {
  const DATABASE_VERSION = 1;
  let { user_version: currentDbVersion } = await db.getFirstAsync<{ user_version: number }>(
    'PRAGMA user_version'
  );
  if (currentDbVersion >= DATABASE_VERSION) {
    return;
  }
  if (currentDbVersion === 0) {
    await db.execAsync(`
PRAGMA journal_mode = 'wal';
CREATE TABLE todos (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, value TEXT NOT NULL, intValue INTEGER);
`);
    await db.runAsync('INSERT INTO todos (value, intValue) VALUES (?, ?)', 'hello', 1);
    await db.runAsync('INSERT INTO todos (value, intValue) VALUES (?, ?)', 'world', 2);
    currentDbVersion = 1;
  }
  // if (currentDbVersion === 1) {
  //   Add more migrations
  // }
  await db.execAsync(`PRAGMA user_version = ${DATABASE_VERSION}`);
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  // Your styles...
});
```

### `useSQLiteContext()` hook with `React.Suspense`

As with the [`useSQLiteContext()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#usesqlitecontext-hook) hook, you can also integrate the [`SQLiteProvider`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#sqliteprovider) with [`React.Suspense`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) to show a fallback component until the database is ready. To enable the integration, pass the `useSuspense` prop to the `SQLiteProvider` component.

```tsx
import { SQLiteProvider, useSQLiteContext } from 'expo-sqlite';
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Suspense fallback={<Fallback />}>
        <SQLiteProvider databaseName="test.db" onInit={migrateDbIfNeeded} useSuspense>
          <Header />
          <Content />
        </SQLiteProvider>
      </Suspense>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Executing queries within an async transaction

```js
const db = await SQLite.openDatabaseAsync('databaseName');

await db.withTransactionAsync(async () => {
  const result = await db.getFirstAsync('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM USERS');
  console.log('Count:', result.rows[0]['COUNT(*)']);
});
```

Due to the nature of async/await, any query that runs while the transaction is active will be included in the transaction. This includes query statements that are outside of the scope function passed to `withTransactionAsync()` and may be surprising behavior. For example, the following test case runs queries inside and outside of a scope function passed to `withTransactionAsync()`. However, all of the queries will run within the actual SQL transaction because the second `UPDATE` query runs before the transaction finishes.

```ts
Promise.all([
  // 1. A new transaction begins
  db.withTransactionAsync(async () => {
    // 2. The value "first" is inserted into the test table and we wait 2
    //    seconds
    await db.execAsync('INSERT INTO test (data) VALUES ("first")');
    await sleep(2000);

    // 4. Two seconds in, we read the latest data from the table
    const row = await db.getFirstAsync<{ data: string }>('SELECT data FROM test');

    // ❌ The data in the table will be "second" and this expectation will fail.
    //    Additionally, this expectation will throw an error and roll back the
    //    transaction, including the `UPDATE` query below since it ran within
    //    the transaction.
    expect(row.data).toBe('first');
  }),
  // 3. One second in, the data in the test table is updated to be "second".
  //    This `UPDATE` query runs in the transaction even though its code is
  //    outside of it because the transaction happens to be active at the time
  //    this query runs.
  sleep(1000).then(async () => db.execAsync('UPDATE test SET data = "second"')),
]);
```

The [`withExclusiveTransactionAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#withexclusivetransactionasynctask) function addresses this. Only queries that run within the scope function passed to `withExclusiveTransactionAsync()` will run within the actual SQL transaction.

### Executing PRAGMA queries

```js
const db = await SQLite.openDatabaseAsync('databaseName');
await db.execAsync('PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL');
await db.execAsync('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON');
```

> **Tip:** Enable [WAL journal mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) when you create a new database to improve performance in general.

### Import an existing database

To open a new SQLite database using an existing **.db** file you already have, you can use the [`SQLiteProvider`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#sqliteprovider) with [`assetSource`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#assetsource).

```tsx
import { SQLiteProvider, useSQLiteContext } from 'expo-sqlite';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <SQLiteProvider databaseName="test.db" assetSource={{ assetId: require('./assets/test.db') }}>
        <Header />
        <Content />
      </SQLiteProvider>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Sharing a database between apps/extensions (iOS)

To share a database with other apps/extensions in the same App Group, you can use shared containers by following the steps below:

Configure the App Group in app config:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.myapp",
      "entitlements": {
        "com.apple.security.application-groups": ["group.com.myapp"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use [`Paths.appleSharedContainers`](/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem#applesharedcontainers) from the [`expo-file-system`](/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem) library to retrieve the path to the shared container:

```tsx
import { SQLiteProvider, defaultDatabaseDirectory } from 'expo-sqlite';
import { Paths } from 'expo-file-system';
import { useMemo } from 'react';
import { Platform, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  const dbDirectory = useMemo(() => {
    if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
      return Object.values(Paths.appleSharedContainers)?.[0]?.uri;
      // or `Paths.appleSharedContainers['group.com.myapp']?.uri` to choose specific container
    }
    return defaultDatabaseDirectory;
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <SQLiteProvider databaseName="test.db" directory={dbDirectory}>
        <Header />
        <Content />
      </SQLiteProvider>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Passing binary data

Use [`Uint8Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) to pass binary data to the database:

```ts
await db.execAsync(`
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS blobs;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS blobs (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, data BLOB);
`);

const blob = new Uint8Array([0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05]);
await db.runAsync('INSERT INTO blobs (data) VALUES (?)', blob);

const row = await db.getFirstAsync<{ data: Uint8Array }>('SELECT * FROM blobs');
expect(row.data).toEqual(blob);
```

### Browse an on-device database

The `expo-sqlite` library includes a built-in DevTools inspector plugin that is automatically enabled in development and requires no extra setup. It lets you browse tables, view and edit rows, run SQL queries, and export databases directly from your browser. To open it, press shift+m in the Expo CLI terminal to open the dev tools menu, and then select **Open expo-sqlite** to launch the inspector.

Alternatively, you can also use the [`drizzle-studio-expo` dev tools plugin](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-studio-expo) to launch [Drizzle Studio](https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview), connected to a database in your app, directly from Expo CLI. This plugin can be used with any `expo-sqlite` configuration and does not require [Drizzle ORM](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#drizzle-orm). [Learn how to install and use the plugin](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-studio-expo).

### Key-value storage

The `expo-sqlite` library provides [`Storage`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#sqlitestorage) as a drop-in replacement for the [`@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage) library. This key-value store is backed by SQLite. If your project already uses `expo-sqlite`, you can leverage `expo-sqlite/kv-store` without needing to add another dependency.

[`Storage`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#sqlitestorage) provides the same API as `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`:

```ts
// The storage API is the default export, you can call it Storage, AsyncStorage, or whatever you prefer.
import Storage from 'expo-sqlite/kv-store';

await Storage.setItem('key', JSON.stringify({ entity: 'value' }));
const value = await Storage.getItem('key');
const entity = JSON.parse(value);
console.log(entity); // { entity: 'value' }
```

A key benefit of using `expo-sqlite/kv-store` is the addition of synchronous APIs for added convenience:

```ts
// The storage API is the default export, you can call it Storage, AsyncStorage, or whatever you prefer.
import Storage from 'expo-sqlite/kv-store';

Storage.setItemSync('key', 'value');
const value = Storage.getItemSync('key');
```

If you're currently using `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` in your project, switching to `expo-sqlite/kv-store` is as simple as changing the import statement:

```diff
- import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
+ import AsyncStorage from 'expo-sqlite/kv-store';
```

### The `localStorage` API

The `expo-sqlite/localStorage/install` module provides a drop-in implementation for the [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) API. If you're already familiar with this API from the web, or you would like to be able to share storage code between web and other platforms, this may be useful. To use it, you just need to import the `expo-sqlite/localStorage/install` module:

> **Note:** `import 'expo-sqlite/localStorage/install';` is a no-op on web and will be excluded from the production JS bundle.

```ts
import 'expo-sqlite/localStorage/install';

globalThis.localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
console.log(globalThis.localStorage.getItem('key')); // 'value'
```

## Security

SQL injections are a class of vulnerabilities where attackers trick your app into executing user input as SQL code. You must escape all user input passed to SQLite to defend against SQL injections. [Prepared statements](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#prepared-statements) are an effective defense against this problem. They explicitly separate a SQL query's logic from its input parameters, and SQLite automatically escapes inputs when executing prepared statements.

## Third-party library integrations

The `expo-sqlite` library is designed to be a solid SQLite foundation. It enables broader integrations with third-party libraries for more advanced higher-level features. Here are some of the libraries that you can use with `expo-sqlite`.

### Drizzle ORM

[Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) is a ["headless TypeScript ORM with a head"](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview). It runs on Node.js, Bun, Deno, and React Native. It also has a CLI companion called [`drizzle-kit`](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/overview) for generating SQL migrations.

Check out the [Drizzle ORM documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/) and the [`expo-sqlite` integration guide](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started/expo-new) for more details.

### Knex.js

[Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/) is a SQL query builder that is ["flexible, portable, and fun to use!"](https://github.com/knex/knex)

Check out the [`expo-sqlite` integration guide](https://github.com/expo/knex-expo-sqlite-dialect) for more details.

## SQLCipher

> **Note:** SQLCipher is not supported on [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go).

[SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) is a fork of SQLite that adds encryption and authentication to the database. The `expo-sqlite` library supports SQLCipher for Android, iOS, and macOS. To use SQLCipher, you need to add the `useSQLCipher` config to your **app.json** as shown in the [Configuration in app config](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#configuration-in-app-config) section and run `npx expo prebuild`.

Right after you open a database, you need to set a password for the database using the `PRAGMA key = 'password'` statement.

```ts
const db = await SQLite.openDatabaseAsync('databaseName');
await db.execAsync(`PRAGMA key = 'password'`);
```

## API

### Cheatsheet for the common API

The following table summarizes the common API for [`SQLiteDatabase`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#sqlitedatabase) and [`SQLiteStatement`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#sqlitestatement) classes:

| [`SQLiteDatabase`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#sqlitedatabase) methods | [`SQLiteStatement`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#sqlitestatement) methods | Description | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`runAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#runasyncsource-params) | [`executeAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#executeasyncparams) | Executes a SQL query, returning information on the changes made. | Ideal for SQL write operations such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`. |
| [`getFirstAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#getfirstasyncsource-params) | [`executeAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#executeasyncparams) + [`getFirstAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#getfirstasync) | Retrieves the first row from the query result. | Suitable for fetching a single row from the database. For example: `getFirstAsync('SELECT * FROM Users WHERE id = ?', userId)`. |
| [`getAllAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#getallasyncsource-params) | [`executeAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#executeasyncparams) + [`getFirstAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#getallasync) | Fetches all query results at once. | Best suited for scenarios with smaller result sets, such as queries with a LIMIT clause, like `SELECT * FROM Table LIMIT 100`, where you intend to retrieve all results in a single batch. |
| [`getEachAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#geteachasyncsource-params) | [`executeAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite#executeasyncparams) + `for-await-of` async iterator | Provides an iterator for result set traversal. This method fetches one row at a time from the database, potentially reducing memory usage compared to `getAllAsync()`. | Recommended for handling large result sets incrementally, such as with infinite scrolling implementations. |

### `SQLiteTaggedQuery`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: Class implements [PromiseLike](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<SQLiteTaggedQueryResult<T\>\>

A SQL query with tagged template literals API that can be awaited directly (returns array of objects by default), or transformed using .values() or .first() methods.

This API is inspired by Bun's SQL interface:

Example

```ts
// Default: returns array of objects
const users = await sql`SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ${21}`;

// Get values as arrays
const values = await sql`SELECT name, age FROM users`.values();
// Returns: [["Alice", 30], ["Bob", 25]]

// Get first row only
const user = await sql`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${1}`.first();

// With type parameter
const users = await sql<User>`SELECT * FROM users`;

// Mutable queries return SQLiteRunResult
const result = await sql`INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (${"Alice"})` as SQLiteRunResult;
console.log(result.lastInsertRowId, result.changes);

// Synchronous API
const users = sql<User>`SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ${21}`.allSync();
const user = sql<User>`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`.firstSync();
```

## Interfaces

### `SQLiteExecuteAsyncResult`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web.

Extends: [AsyncIterableIterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AsyncIterator)<T\>

A result returned by [`SQLiteStatement.executeAsync()`](#executeasyncparams).

Example

The result includes the [`lastInsertRowId`](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/last_insert_rowid.html) and [`changes`](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/changes.html) properties. You can get the information from the write operations.

```ts
const statement = await db.prepareAsync('INSERT INTO test (value) VALUES (?)');
try {
  const result = await statement.executeAsync(101);
  console.log('lastInsertRowId:', result.lastInsertRowId);
  console.log('changes:', result.changes);
} finally {
  await statement.finalizeAsync();
}
```

Example

The result implements the [`AsyncIterator`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/asyncIterator) interface, so you can use it in `for await...of` loops.

```ts
const statement = await db.prepareAsync('SELECT value FROM test WHERE value > ?');
try {
  const result = await statement.executeAsync<{ value: number }>(100);
  for await (const row of result) {

Example

If your write operations also return values, you can mix all of them together.

```ts
const statement = await db.prepareAsync('INSERT INTO test (name, value) VALUES (?, ?) RETURNING name');
try {
  const result = await statement.executeAsync<{ name: string }>('John Doe', 101);
  console.log('lastInsertRowId:', result.lastInsertRowId);

# Expo StatusBar

A library that provides the same interface as the React Native StatusBar API, but with slightly different defaults to work great in Expo environments.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-status-bar` gives you a component and imperative interface to control the app status bar to change its text color, background color, hide it, make it translucent or opaque, and apply animations to any of these changes. Exactly what you are able to do with the `StatusBar` component depends on the platform you're using.

> **tvOS and web support**
> 
> For **tvOS**, the `expo-status-bar` code will compile and run, but no status bar will show.
> 
> For **web**, there is no API available to control the operating system's status bar, so `expo-status-bar` will do nothing and won't throw an error.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-status-bar
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

```jsx
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Notice that the status bar has light text!</Text>
      <StatusBar style="light" />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#000',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    color: '#fff',
  },
});
```

## API

```js
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';
```

## Component

### `StatusBar`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Type: React.[Element](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#function-component)<[StatusBarProps](#statusbarprops)\>

A component that allows you to configure your status bar without directly calling imperative methods like `setBarStyle`.

You will likely have multiple `StatusBar` components mounted in the same app at the same time. For example, if you have multiple screens in your app, you may end up using one per screen. The props of each `StatusBar` component will be merged in the order that they were mounted. This component is built on top of the [StatusBar](https://reactnative.dev/docs/statusbar) component exported from React Native, and it provides defaults that work better for Expo users.

StatusBarProps

### `animated`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `boolean`

If the transition between status bar property changes should be animated. Supported for `backgroundColor`, `barStyle` and `hidden`.

> **Deprecated:** Due to Android edge-to-edge enforcement, setting the status bar background color is deprecated and has no effect. This will be removed in a future release.

### `backgroundColor`

Supported platforms: Android.

Optional • Type: `string`

The background color of the status bar.

### `hidden`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: `boolean`

If the status bar is hidden.

### `hideTransitionAnimation`

Supported platforms: iOS.

Optional • Type: [StatusBarAnimation](#statusbaranimation) • Default: `'fade'`

The transition effect when showing and hiding the status bar using the hidden prop.

> **Deprecated:** The status bar network activity indicator is not supported in iOS 13 and later. This will be removed in a future release.

### `networkActivityIndicatorVisible`

Supported platforms: iOS.

Optional • Type: `boolean`

If the network activity indicator should be visible.

### `style`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Optional • Type: [StatusBarStyle](#statusbarstyle) • Default: `'auto'`

Sets the color of the status bar text. Default value is `"auto"` which picks the appropriate value according to the active color scheme, eg: if your app is dark mode, the style will be `"light"`.

> **Deprecated:** Due to Android edge-to-edge enforcement, setting the status bar as translucent is deprecated and has no effect. This will be removed in a future release.

### `translucent`

Supported platforms: Android.

Optional • Type: `boolean`

If the status bar is translucent. When translucent is set to `true`, the app will draw under the status bar. This is the default behaviour in projects created with Expo tools because it is consistent with iOS.

# Expo StoreReview

A library that provides access to native APIs for in-app reviews.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

`expo-store-review` is a library that provides access to `ReviewManager` API on Android 5+ and `SKStoreReviewController` API on iOS. It allows you to ask the user to rate your app without leaving the app itself.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-store-review
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

It is important that you follow the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ratings-and-reviews) for iOS and [Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review#when-to-request) for Android when using this API.

**Specifically:**

-   Don't call `StoreReview.requestReview()` from a button - instead try calling it after the user has finished some signature interaction in the app.
-   Don't spam the user.
-   Don't request a review when the user is doing something time sensitive like navigating.
-   Don't ask the user any questions before or while presenting the rating button or card.

### Write reviews

#### Android

There is no equivalent redirect on Android, you can still open the Play Store to the reviews sections using the query parameter `showAllReviews=true` like this:

```ts
const androidPackageName = 'host.exp.exponent';
// Open the Android Play Store in the browser -> redirects to Play Store on Android
Linking.openURL(
  `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=${androidPackageName}&showAllReviews=true`
);
// Open the Android Play Store directly
Linking.openURL(`market://details?id=${androidPackageName}&showAllReviews=true`);
```

#### iOS

You can redirect an app user to the **"Write a Review"** screen for an app in the iOS App Store by using the query parameter `action=write-review`. For example:

```ts
const itunesItemId = 982107779;
// Open the iOS App Store in the browser -> redirects to App Store on iOS
Linking.openURL(`https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id${itunesItemId}?action=write-review`);
// Open the iOS App Store directly
Linking.openURL(
  `itms-apps://itunes.apple.com/app/viewContentsUserReviews/id${itunesItemId}?action=write-review`
);
```

## API

```js
import * as StoreReview from 'expo-store-review';
```

## Methods

### `StoreReview.hasAction()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

This returns a promise that fulfills to `true` if `StoreReview.requestReview()` is capable directing the user to some kind of store review flow. If the app config (`app.json`) does not contain store URLs and native store review capabilities are not available then the promise will fulfill to `false`.

Example

```ts
if (await StoreReview.hasAction()) {
  // you can call StoreReview.requestReview()
}
```

### `StoreReview.isAvailableAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Determines if the platform has the capabilities to use `StoreReview.requestReview()`.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

This returns a promise fulfills with `boolean`, depending on the platform:

-   On iOS, it will resolve to `true` unless the app is distributed through TestFlight.
-   On Android, it will resolve to `true` if the device is running Android 5.0+.
-   On Web, it will resolve to `false`.

### `StoreReview.requestReview()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

In ideal circumstances this will open a native modal and allow the user to select a star rating that will then be applied to the App Store, without leaving the app. If the device is running a version of Android lower than 5.0, this will attempt to get the store URL and link the user to it.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `StoreReview.storeUrl()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

This uses the `Constants` API to get the `Constants.expoConfig.ios.appStoreUrl` on iOS, or the `Constants.expoConfig.android.playStoreUrl` on Android.

On Web this will return `null`.

Returns: `string | null`

## Error codes

### `ERR_STORE_REVIEW_FAILED`

This error occurs when the store review request was not successful.

# @stripe/stripe-react-native

A library that provides access to native APIs for integrating Stripe payments.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

Expo includes support for [`@stripe/stripe-react-native`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), which allows you to build delightful payment experiences in your native Android and iOS apps using React Native and Expo. This library provides powerful and customizable UI screens and elements that can be used out-of-the-box to collect your users' payment details.

> Migrating from Expo's `expo-payments-stripe` module? [Learn more about how to transition to the new `@stripe/stripe-react-native` library](https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/main/payments-migration-guide.md#how-to-migrate-from-expo-payments-stripe-to-the-new-stripestripe-react-native-library).

[Watch: Universal Full-Stack Expo Stripe Payment Integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0tyxUV_omY)

## Installation

Each Expo SDK version requires a specific `@stripe/stripe-react-native` version. See the [Stripe CHANGELOG](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a mapping of versions. To automatically install the correct version for your Expo SDK version, run:

```sh
npx expo install @stripe/stripe-react-native
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project. Then, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native) provided in the library's README or documentation.

### Config plugin setup (optional)

If you're using EAS Build, you can do most of your Stripe setup using the `@stripe/stripe-react-native` [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction). To set up, just add the config plugin to the `plugins` array of your **app.json** or **app.config.js** as shown below, then rebuild the app.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    ... 
    "plugins": [
      [
        "@stripe/stripe-react-native",
        {
          "merchantIdentifier": string | string [],
          "enableGooglePay": boolean
        }
      ]
    ],
  }
}
```

-   **merchantIdentifier**: iOS only. This is the [Apple merchant ID obtained here](https://stripe.com/docs/apple-pay?platform=react-native). Otherwise, Apple Pay will not work as expected. If you have multiple merchantIdentifiers, you can set them in an array.
-   **enableGooglePay**: Android only. Boolean indicating whether or not Google Pay is enabled. Defaults to `false`.

## Example

Trying out Stripe takes just a few seconds. Connect to [this Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/@charliecruzan/stripe-react-native-example?platform=mydevice) on your device.

Under the hood, that example connects to [this Glitch server code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/expo-stripe-server-example), so you'll need to open that page to spin up the server. Feel free to run your own Glitch server and copy that code!

## Usage

For usage information and detailed documentation, see the following resources:

-   [Stripe's React Native SDK reference](https://stripe.dev/stripe-react-native/api-reference/index.html)
-   [Stripe's React Native GitHub repo](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native)
-   [Stripe's example React Native app](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/tree/master/example)

### Common issues

#### Browser pop-ups are not redirecting back to my app

If you're relying on redirects, you'll need to pass in a `urlScheme` to `initStripe`. To make sure you always use the proper `urlScheme`, pass in:

```js
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';
import Constants from 'expo-constants';

urlScheme:
  Constants.appOwnership === 'expo'
    ? Linking.createURL('/--/')
    : Linking.createURL(''),
```

[`Linking.createURL()`](/versions/latest/sdk/linking#createurloptions) will ensure you're using the proper scheme, whether you're running in Expo Go or your production app. `'/--/'` is necessary in Expo Go because it indicates that the substring after it corresponds to the deep link path, and is not part of the path to the app itself.

#### PaymentSheet localization on iOS

On Android, the translation of `PaymentSheet` is automatically detected based on a device's language settings.

On iOS, you must enable `CFBundleAllowMixedLocalizations` and add the preferred language using `CFBundleLocalizations` under [`ios.infoPlist`](/versions/latest/config/app#infoplist) in the app config:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "infoPlist": {
        "CFBundleAllowMixedLocalizations": true,
        "CFBundleLocalizations": ["fr"]
        ... 
      }
      ... 
    }
  }
}
```

## Limitations

### Google Pay

Google Pay **is not** supported in [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go). To use Google Pay, you must create a [development build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build). This can be done with [EAS Build](/build/introduction), or locally by running `npx expo run:android`.

### Apple Pay

Apple Pay **is not** supported in [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go). To use Apple Pay, you must create a [development build](/develop/development-builds/create-a-build). This can be done with [EAS Build](/build/introduction), or locally by running `npx expo run:ios`.

packageName: 'expo-system-ui'
platforms: ['android', 'ios', 'tvos', 'web']

# Expo SystemUI

A library that allows interacting with system UI elements.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web

`expo-system-ui` enables you to interact with UI elements that fall outside of the React tree. Specifically the root view background color, and locking the user interface style globally on Android.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-system-ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-system-ui` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure [`userInterfaceStyle`](/versions/latest/config/app#userinterfacestyle) on Android and [`backgroundColor`](/versions/latest/config/app#backgroundcolor) on iOS properties from [app config](/versions/latest/config/app). These properties cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "backgroundColor": "#ffffff",
    "userInterfaceStyle": "light",
    "ios": {
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff",
    }
    "android": {
      "userInterfaceStyle": "light"
    },
    "plugins": ["expo-system-ui"],
  }
}
```

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using native **android** and **ios** project manually, then you need to add the following configuration to your native project:

**Android**

To apply `userInterfaceStyle` on Android, you need to add the `expo_system_ui_user_interface_style` configuration **android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml**:

```xml
<resources>
  <!-- ... -->
  <string name="expo_system_ui_user_interface_style" translatable="false">light</string> <!-- or dark -->
</resources>
```

**iOS**

To apply `backgroundColor` on iOS, you need to add the `UIUserInterfaceStyle` configuration in **ios/your-app/Info.plist**:

```xml
<plist>
  <dict>
    <!-- ... -->
    <key>UIUserInterfaceStyle</key>
    <string>Light</string> <!-- or Dark -->
  </dict>
</plist>
```

## API

```js
import * as SystemUI from 'expo-system-ui';
```

## Methods

### `SystemUI.getBackgroundColorAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Gets the root view background color.

Returns: `Promise<colorvalue>`

Current root view background color in hex format. Returns `null` if the background color is not set.

Example

```ts
const color = await SystemUI.getBackgroundColorAsync();
```

### `SystemUI.setBackgroundColorAsync(color)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `color` | [ColorValue](https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors) | null | Any valid [CSS 3 (SVG) color](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#svg-color). |

  

Changes the root view background color. Call this function in the root file outside of your component.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

Example

```ts
SystemUI.setBackgroundColorAsync("black");
```

# Expo TaskManager

A library that provides support for tasks that can run in the background.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Included in Expo Go

`expo-task-manager` provides an API that allows you to manage long-running tasks, in particular those tasks that can run while your app is in the background. Some features of this library are used by other libraries under the hood. Here is a list of Expo SDK libraries that use `TaskManager`.

## Libraries using Expo TaskManager

-   [Location](/versions/latest/sdk/location)
-   [BackgroundTask](/versions/latest/sdk/background-task)
-   [BackgroundFetch](/versions/latest/sdk/background-fetch)
-   [Notifications](/versions/latest/sdk/notifications)

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-task-manager
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

  

> You can test `TaskManager` in the Expo Go app. However, check the documentation of each [library](/versions/latest/sdk/task-manager#libraries-using-expo-taskmanager) that uses `TaskManager` to confirm whether it supports testing in Expo Go.

## Configuration 

Standalone apps need some extra configuration: on iOS, each background feature requires a special key in `UIBackgroundModes` array in your **Info.plist** file.

Read more about how to configure this in the reference for each of the [libraries](/versions/latest/sdk/task-manager#libraries-using-expo-taskmanager) that use `TaskManager`.

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';
import * as Location from 'expo-location';

const LOCATION_TASK_NAME = 'background-location-task';

const requestPermissions = async () => {
  const { status: foregroundStatus } = await Location.requestForegroundPermissionsAsync();
  if (foregroundStatus === 'granted') {
    const { status: backgroundStatus } = await Location.requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync();
    if (backgroundStatus === 'granted') {
      await Location.startLocationUpdatesAsync(LOCATION_TASK_NAME, {
        accuracy: Location.Accuracy.Balanced,
      });
    }
  }
};

const PermissionsButton = () => (
  <View style={styles.container}>
    <Button onPress={requestPermissions} title="Enable background location" />

## API

```js
import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';
```

## Methods

### `TaskManager.defineTask(taskName, taskExecutor)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `taskName` | `string` | Name of the task. It must be the same as the name you provided when registering the task. |
| `taskExecutor` | [TaskManagerTaskExecutor](/versions/latest/sdk/task-manager#taskmanagertaskexecutorbody)<T\> | A function that will be invoked when the task with given `taskName` is executed. |

  

Defines task function. It must be called in the global scope of your JavaScript bundle. In particular, it cannot be called in any of React lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`. This limitation is due to the fact that when the application is launched in the background, we need to spin up your JavaScript app, run your task and then shut down — no views are mounted in this scenario.

Returns: `void`

### `TaskManager.getRegisteredTasksAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Provides information about tasks registered in the app.

Returns: `Promise<taskmanagertask[]>`

A promise which fulfills with an array of tasks registered in the app.

Example

```js
[
  {
    taskName: 'location-updates-task-name',
    taskType: 'location',
    options: {
      accuracy: Location.Accuracy.High,
      showsBackgroundLocationIndicator: false,
    },
  },
  {
    taskName: 'geofencing-task-name',
    taskType: 'geofencing',
    options: {
      regions: [...],
    },
  },
]
```

### `TaskManager.getTaskOptionsAsync(taskName)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `taskName` | `string` | Name of the task. |

  

Retrieves `options` associated with the task, that were passed to the function registering the task (e.g. `Location.startLocationUpdatesAsync`).

Returns: `Promise<taskoptions>`

A promise which fulfills with the `options` object that was passed while registering task with given name or `null` if task couldn't be found.

### `TaskManager.isAvailableAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Determine if the `TaskManager` API can be used in this app.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

A promise which fulfills with `true` if the API can be used, and `false` otherwise. With Expo Go, `TaskManager` is not available on Android, and does not support background execution on iOS. Use a development build to avoid limitations: [https://expo.fyi/dev-client](https://expo.fyi/dev-client). On the web, it always returns `false`.

### `TaskManager.isTaskDefined(taskName)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `taskName` | `string` | Name of the task. |

  

Checks whether the task is already defined.

Returns: `boolean`

### `TaskManager.isTaskRegisteredAsync(taskName)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `taskName` | `string` | Name of the task. |

  

Determine whether the task is registered. Registered tasks are stored in a persistent storage and preserved between sessions.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

A promise which resolves to `true` if a task with the given name is registered, otherwise `false`.

### `TaskManager.unregisterAllTasksAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Unregisters all tasks registered for the running app. You may want to call this when the user is signing out and you no longer need to track his location or run any other background tasks.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A promise which fulfills as soon as all tasks are completely unregistered.

### `TaskManager.unregisterTaskAsync(taskName)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `taskName` | `string` | Name of the task to unregister. |

  

Unregisters task from the app, so the app will not be receiving updates for that task anymore. _It is recommended to use methods specialized by modules that registered the task, eg. [`Location.stopLocationUpdatesAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/location#expolocationstoplocationupdatesasynctaskname)._

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A promise which fulfills as soon as the task is unregistered.

## Interfaces

# Third-party libraries supported in Expo Go

A set of third-party libraries which support for is included by default in Expo Go environment.

The Expo Go playground enables students and learners to quickly try out building native Android and iOS apps. It supports a curated list of third-party libraries that are community-driven, provide APIs for common app functionalities, and are tested with each Expo SDK release.

The difference between libraries listed in this section, and any other third-party library is that the support for former is built-in in Expo Go environment. You may use any library of your choice with development builds.

title: TrackingTransparency
description: A library for tracking app users and managing tracking permissions.

packageName: 'expo-tracking-transparency'
platforms: ['android', 'ios', 'tvos', 'expo-go']

# Expo TrackingTransparency

A library for tracking app users and managing tracking permissions.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Included in Expo Go

A library for tracking app users and managing tracking permissions. Provides access to advertising identifiers and manages the required permissions for tracking. Examples of data used for tracking include email address, device ID, advertising ID, and more. If the "Allow Apps to Request to Track" device-level setting is off, this permission will be denied. Be sure to add `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` to your [**Info.plist**](/versions/latest/config/app#infoplist) to explain how the user will be tracked. Otherwise, your app will be rejected by Apple.

For more information on Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework, see their [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-tracking-transparency
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-tracking-transparency` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-tracking-transparency",
        {
          "userTrackingPermission": "This identifier will be used to deliver personalized ads to you."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `userTrackingPermission` | `"Allow this app to collect app-related data that can be used for tracking you or your device."` | Only for: iOS. Sets the iOS `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` permission message in **Info.plist**. |

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) (you're using native **android** and **ios** projects manually), then you need to configure following permissions in your native projects:

-   For Android, add `com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID` permission to your project's **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**.
    
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID"/>
    ```
    
-   For iOS, add `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` key to your project's **ios/[app]/Info.plist**:
    
    ```xml
    <key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Your custom usage description string here.</string>
    ```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { Text, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';
import { requestTrackingPermissionsAsync } from 'expo-tracking-transparency';

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await requestTrackingPermissionsAsync();
      if (status === 'granted') {
        console.log('Yay! I have user permission to track data');
      }
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Tracking Transparency Module Example</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

## API

```ts
import * as ExpoTrackingTransparency from 'expo-tracking-transparency';
```

## Hooks

### `useTrackingPermissions(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | `PermissionHookOptions<object>` |

  

Check or request the user to authorize or deny access to app-related data that can be used for tracking the user or the device. Examples of data used for tracking include email address, device ID, advertising ID, and so on. On iOS, if the user denies this permission, any attempt to collect the IDFA will return a string of 0s.

The system remembers the user’s choice and doesn’t prompt again unless a user uninstalls and then reinstalls the app on the device.

On Android and web, this method always returns that the permission was granted.

Returns: `[PermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<permissionresponse>, GetPermissionMethod]</permissionresponse>`

Example

```ts
const [status, requestPermission] = useTrackingPermissions();
```

## Methods

### `getAdvertisingId()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Gets the advertising ID, a UUID string intended only for advertising. Use this string for frequency capping, attribution, conversion events, estimating the number of unique users, advertising fraud detection, and debugging.

As a best practice, don't store the advertising ID. Instead, call this function each time your app needs to use the advertising ID. Users can change whether they allow app tracking and can reset their advertising ID at any time in their system settings. Check your app's authorization using [`getTrackingPermissionsAsync()`](#gettrackingpermissionsasync) to determine the user's intent.

On Android, this function returns the "Android Advertising ID" ([AAID](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/identifier/AdvertisingIdClient.Info#public-string-getid)). On Android devices that support multiple users, including guest users, it's possible for your app to obtain different advertising IDs on the same device. These different IDs correspond to different users who could be signed in on that device. See Google's documentation for more information: [Get a user-resettable advertising ID](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/ad-id).

On iOS, this function returns the "Identifier for Advertisers" ([IDFA](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/adsupport/asidentifiermanager/advertisingidentifier)), a string that's unique to each device. Your app must request tracking authorization using [`requestTrackingPermissionsAsync()`](#requesttrackingpermissionsasync) before it can get the advertising identifier.

Returns: `string | null`

Returns either a UUID `string` or `null`. It returns null in the following cases:

-   On Android, when `isLimitAdTrackingEnabled()` is `true`
-   In the iOS simulator, regardless of any settings
-   On iOS if you haven't received permission using [`requestTrackingPermissionsAsync()`](#requesttrackingpermissionsasync)
-   On iOS, if you've requested permission and the user declines
-   On iOS, when a profile or configuration restricts access to the advertising identifier, such as when the user has turned off the system-wide "Allow Apps to Request to Track" setting

Example

```ts
TrackingTransparency.getAdvertisingId();
// "E9228286-4C4E-4789-9D95-15827DCB291B"
```

### `getTrackingPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Checks whether or not the user has authorized the app to access app-related data that can be used for tracking the user or the device. See `requestTrackingPermissionsAsync` for more details.

On Android and web, this method always returns that the permission was granted.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

Example

```typescript
const { granted } = await getTrackingPermissionsAsync();

if (granted) {
  // Your app is authorized to track the user or their device
}
```

### `isAvailable()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Returns whether the TrackingTransparency API is available on the current device.

Returns: `boolean`

On devices where the Tracking Transparency API is unavailable, the get and request permissions methods will always resolve to `granted`.

### `requestTrackingPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Requests the user to authorize or deny access to app-related data that can be used for tracking the user or the device. Examples of data used for tracking include email address, device ID, advertising ID, and so on. On iOS, if the user denies this permission, any attempt to collect the IDFA will return a string of 0s.

The system remembers the user’s choice and doesn’t prompt again unless a user uninstalls and then reinstalls the app on the device.

On Android and web, this method always returns that the permission was granted.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

Example

```typescript
const { granted } = await requestTrackingPermissionsAsync();

if (granted) {
  // Your app is authorized to track the user or their device
}
```

## Types

### `PermissionExpiration`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Literal Type: `union`

Permission expiration time. Currently, all permissions are granted permanently.

Acceptable values are: `'never'` | `number`

### `PermissionHookOptions`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Literal Type: `union`

Acceptable values are: `PermissionHookBehavior` | `Options`

### `PermissionResponse`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

An object obtained by permissions get and request functions.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| canAskAgain | `boolean` | Indicates if user can be asked again for specific permission. If not, one should be directed to the Settings app in order to enable/disable the permission. |
| expires | `PermissionExpiration` | Determines time when the permission expires. |
| granted | `boolean` | A convenience boolean that indicates if the permission is granted. |
| status | `PermissionStatus` | Determines the status of the permission. |

## Enums

### `PermissionStatus`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

#### `DENIED`

`PermissionStatus.DENIED = "denied"`

User has denied the permission.

#### `GRANTED`

`PermissionStatus.GRANTED = "granted"`

User has granted the permission.

#### `UNDETERMINED`

`PermissionStatus.UNDETERMINED = "undetermined"`

User hasn't granted or denied the permission yet.

## Permissions

### Android

The following permissions are added automatically through the library's **AndroidManifest.xml**.

| Android Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID` | Allows access to the Advertising ID for tracking and analytics. Required for apps targeting Android 13 (API level 33) or higher that use Google Play services' Advertising ID. |

### iOS

The following usage description keys are used by this library:

| Info.plist Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` | A message that informs the user why an app is requesting permission to use data for tracking the user or the device. |

# Host

A Jetpack Compose Host component for bridging React Native and Jetpack Compose.
Android

The `Host` component is the bridge between React Native and Jetpack Compose. Every Jetpack Compose component from `@expo/ui/jetpack-compose` must be wrapped in a `Host` to render correctly.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Match contents

Use the `matchContents` prop to make the `Host` size itself to fit the content. You can pass a boolean or an object to control vertical and horizontal sizing independently.

```tsx
import { Host, Button } from '@expo/ui/jetpack-compose';

export default function MatchContents() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Button onPress={() => console.log('Pressed')}>Sized to content</Button>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### With style

Apply standard React Native styles to the `Host` wrapper.

```tsx
import { Host, Button } from '@expo/ui/jetpack-compose';

export default function HostWithStyle() {
  return (
    <Host style={{ padding: 16, backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0', borderRadius: 8 }}>
      <Button onPress={() => console.log('Pressed')}>Styled host</Button>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

## API

```tsx
import { Host } from '@expo/ui/jetpack-compose';
```

A Jetpack Compose ListItem component for displaying structured list entries.
Android

A list item component that follows Material Design 3 guidelines for structured list entries with headline, supporting text, and leading/trailing slots. See the [official Jetpack Compose documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/components/lists) for more information.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Basic list item

```tsx
import { Host, ListItem } from '@expo/ui/jetpack-compose';

export default function BasicListItem() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <ListItem headline="Settings" />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### With supporting text and overline

Use the `supportingText` prop to add a secondary line and `overlineText` for a category label above the headline.

```tsx
import { Host, ListItem } from '@expo/ui/jetpack-compose';

export default function ListItemWithText() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <ListItem
        overlineText="ACCOUNT"
        headline="Profile"
        supportingText="Manage your account settings and preferences"
      />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### With leading and trailing slots

Use `ListItem.Leading` and `ListItem.Trailing` sub-components to add content to the start and end of the list item.

```tsx
import { Host, ListItem, Icon } from '@expo/ui/jetpack-compose';

export default function ListItemWithSlots() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <ListItem headline="Notifications" supportingText="Manage notification preferences">
        <ListItem.Leading>
          <Icon source={require('./assets/notifications.xml')} contentDescription="Notifications" />
        </ListItem.Leading>
        <ListItem.Trailing>
          <Icon source={require('./assets/chevron_forward.xml')} contentDescription="Navigate" />
        </ListItem.Trailing>
      </ListItem>

# Modifiers

Jetpack Compose layout modifiers for @expo/ui components.
Android

Jetpack Compose modifiers allow you to customize the layout, appearance, and behavior of UI components. Modifiers are the Compose equivalent of style properties — they control sizing, padding, backgrounds, interactions, and more.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

Modifiers are applied to components using the `modifiers` prop with an array syntax. You can combine multiple modifiers to create complex styling and behavior. Modifiers are applied in the order they appear in the array, which can affect the final result (for example, applying `padding` before `background` produces different results than the reverse).

```tsx
import { Button, Host } from '@expo/ui/jetpack-compose';
import {
  paddingAll,
  fillMaxWidth,
  background,
  border,
  shadow,
  clickable,
} from '@expo/ui/jetpack-compose/modifiers';

function ModifiersExample() {
  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      {/* Basic styling modifiers */}
      <Button modifiers={[paddingAll(16), fillMaxWidth(), background('#FF6B6B')]}>
        Full-width padded button
      </Button>

      {/* Complex combination with border and shadow */}
      <Button modifiers={[paddingAll(12), background('#4ECDC4'), border(2, '#2C3E50'), shadow(4)]}>
        Styled with border and shadow
      </Button>
    </Host>
  );

# Picker

A Jetpack Compose Picker component for selecting options from a list.
Android

Expo UI Picker matches the official Jetpack Compose [Segmented Button](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/components/segmented-button) and [Radio Button](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/components/radio-button) APIs and supports segmented and radio picker variants.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Segmented picker

Use the `variant="segmented"` prop to display a segmented button group.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, Picker } from '@expo/ui/jetpack-compose';

export default function SegmentedPickerExample() {
  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Picker
        options={['$', '$$', '$$$', '$$$$']}
        selectedIndex={selectedIndex}
        onOptionSelected={({ nativeEvent: { index } }) => {
          setSelectedIndex(index);
        }}
        variant="segmented"
      />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Radio picker

Use the `variant="radio"` prop to display a list of radio buttons.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, Picker } from '@expo/ui/jetpack-compose';

export default function RadioPickerExample() {
  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Picker
        options={['Small', 'Medium', 'Large']}
        selectedIndex={selectedIndex}
        onOptionSelected={({ nativeEvent: { index } }) => {
          setSelectedIndex(index);
        }}
        variant="radio"
      />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Picker with custom color

Use the `color` prop to customize the picker's accent color.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, Picker } from '@expo/ui/jetpack-compose';

export default function CustomColorPickerExample() {
  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);

# Slider

A Jetpack Compose Slider component for selecting values from a range.
Android

Expo UI Slider matches the official Jetpack Compose [Slider API](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/components/slider) and allows selecting values from a bounded range.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Basic slider

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, Slider } from '@expo/ui/jetpack-compose';

export default function BasicSliderExample() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0.5);

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Slider value={value} onValueChange={setValue} />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Slider with custom range

Use the `min` and `max` props to define the slider's value range.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, Slider } from '@expo/ui/jetpack-compose';

export default function CustomRangeSliderExample() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(50);

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Slider value={value} min={0} max={100} onValueChange={setValue} />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Slider with steps

Use the `steps` prop to define discrete increments. Set `steps` to `0` for continuous values.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, Slider } from '@expo/ui/jetpack-compose';

export default function SteppedSliderExample() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);

## Component

### `Text`

Supported platforms: Android.

Type: React.[Element](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#function-component)<[TextProps](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text#props)\>

Renders a Text component using Jetpack Compose.

The Text component provides comprehensive text styling capabilities. The API is aligned with Jetpack Compose's Text composable, where:

-   Top-level props (color, maxLines, etc.) match Compose's Text parameters
-   `style` object corresponds to TextStyle, including typography, fontSize, fontWeight, textAlign, etc.
-   `style.typography` applies Material 3 typography styles (like MaterialTheme.typography)

Example

Basic usage:

```tsx
import { Text } from 'expo-ui';

<Text>Hello World</Text>
```

Example

Using Material 3 Typography (matches Jetpack Compose MaterialTheme.typography):

```tsx
<Text style={{ typography: "bodyLarge" }}>Body text</Text>
<Text style={{ typography: "headlineMedium" }}>Headline</Text>
<Text style={{ typography: "titleSmall" }}>Small title</Text>
```

Example

Typography with style overrides:

```tsx
<Text
  color="#007AFF"
  style={{
    typography: "bodyLarge",
    fontWeight: "bold"  // Override the typography's font weight
  }}
>
  Custom styled body text
</Text>
```

Example

With custom style object (matches Jetpack Compose TextStyle):

```tsx
<Text
  color="#007AFF"
  style={{
    fontSize: 18,
    fontWeight: "bold",
    textAlign: "center",
    letterSpacing: 1.2
  }}
  modifiers={[ExpoUI.padding(16)]}
>
  Styled text
</Text>
```

Example

Text truncation with ellipsis:

```tsx
<Text
  maxLines={2}
  overflow="ellipsis"
>
  This is a very long text that will be truncated after two lines
  with an ellipsis at the end to indicate there's more content...
</Text>

# BottomSheet

A SwiftUI BottomSheet component that presents content from the bottom of the screen.
iOS, tvOS

Expo UI BottomSheet matches the official SwiftUI [sheet API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/sheet\(ispresented:ondismiss:content:\)) and presents content from the bottom of the screen.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Basic bottom sheet

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, BottomSheet, Button, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function BasicBottomSheetExample() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <VStack>
        <Button label="Open Sheet" onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)} />
        <BottomSheet isPresented={isPresented} onIsPresentedChange={setIsPresented}>
          <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
        </BottomSheet>
      </VStack>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Bottom sheet that fits content

Use the [`fitToContents`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/bottomsheet#fittocontents) prop to automatically size the sheet to fit its content.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, BottomSheet, Button, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function BottomSheetFitsContentExample() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <VStack>
        <Button label="Open Sheet" onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)} />
        <BottomSheet isPresented={isPresented} onIsPresentedChange={setIsPresented} fitToContents>
          <VStack>
            <Text>This sheet automatically sizes to fit its content.</Text>
            <Button label="Close" onPress={() => setIsPresented(false)} />
          </VStack>
        </BottomSheet>
      </VStack>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Bottom sheet with presentation detents

Use the [`presentationDetents`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#presentationdetentsdetents-options) modifier on `Group` to control the available heights. You can use:

-   `'medium'`: System medium height (approximately half screen)
-   `'large'`: System large height (full screen)
-   `{ fraction: number }`: Fraction of screen height (0-1)
-   `{ height: number }`: Fixed height in points

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, BottomSheet, Button, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { presentationDetents } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function BottomSheetWithDetentsExample() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <VStack>
        <Button label="Open Sheet" onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)} />
        <BottomSheet isPresented={isPresented} onIsPresentedChange={setIsPresented}>
          <Group
            modifiers={[
              presentationDetents(['medium', 'large', { fraction: 0.3 }, { height: 200 }]),
            ]}>
            <Text>This sheet can snap to multiple heights.</Text>
          </Group>
        </BottomSheet>
      </VStack>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Bottom sheet with detent selection tracking

Pass `selection` and `onSelectionChange` options to [`presentationDetents`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#presentationdetentsdetents-options) to programmatically control which detent the sheet snaps to.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, BottomSheet, Button, List, Section, Text, VStack, Group } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import {
  presentationDetents,
  presentationDragIndicator,
  foregroundStyle,
} from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';
import type { PresentationDetent } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function BottomSheetWithDetentSelectionExample() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);
  const detents: PresentationDetent[] = [{ height: 300 }, { fraction: 0.3 }, 'medium', 'large'];
  const [selectedDetent, setSelectedDetent] = useState<PresentationDetent>('medium');

  const formatDetent = (detent: PresentationDetent): string => {
    if (typeof detent === 'string') return detent;
    if ('fraction' in detent) return `Fraction ${detent.fraction}`;
    return `Height ${detent.height}`;
  };

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <VStack>
        <Button label="Show Sheet" onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)} />
        <BottomSheet isPresented={isPresented} onIsPresentedChange={setIsPresented}>
          <Group
            modifiers={[
              presentationDetents(detents, {
                selection: selectedDetent,
                onSelectionChange: setSelectedDetent,
              }),
              presentationDragIndicator('visible'),
            ]}>
            <List>
              <Section title="Change Detent">
                <Button label="Height 300" onPress={() => setSelectedDetent({ height: 300 })} />
                <Button label="Fraction 0.3" onPress={() => setSelectedDetent({ fraction: 0.3 })} />
                <Button label="Medium" onPress={() => setSelectedDetent('medium')} />
                <Button label="Large" onPress={() => setSelectedDetent('large')} />
              </Section>
              <Section title="Current">
                <Text modifiers={[foregroundStyle('secondaryLabel')]}>
                  {formatDetent(selectedDetent)}
                </Text>
              </Section>
            </List>
          </Group>
        </BottomSheet>
      </VStack>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Bottom sheet with background interaction

Use the [`presentationBackgroundInteraction`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#presentationbackgroundinteractioninteraction) modifier to allow interactions with content behind the sheet.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, BottomSheet, Button, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import {
  presentationDetents,
  presentationBackgroundInteraction,
} from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function BottomSheetWithBackgroundInteractionExample() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <VStack>
        <Button label="Open Sheet" onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)} />
        <BottomSheet isPresented={isPresented} onIsPresentedChange={setIsPresented}>
          <Group
            modifiers={[
              presentationDetents(['medium', 'large']),
              presentationBackgroundInteraction({ type: 'enabledUpThrough', detent: 'medium' }),
            ]}>
            <Text>Interact with content behind when at medium height.</Text>
          </Group>
        </BottomSheet>
      </VStack>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Non-dismissible bottom sheet

Use the [`interactiveDismissDisabled`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#interactivedismissdisabledisdisabled) modifier to prevent users from dismissing the sheet by swiping.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, BottomSheet, Button, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { interactiveDismissDisabled } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function NonDismissibleBottomSheetExample() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <VStack>
        <Button label="Open Sheet" onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)} />
        <BottomSheet isPresented={isPresented} onIsPresentedChange={setIsPresented}>
          <Group modifiers={[interactiveDismissDisabled()]}>
            <VStack>
              <Text>This sheet cannot be dismissed by swiping.</Text>
              <Button label="Close" onPress={() => setIsPresented(false)} />
            </VStack>
          </Group>
        </BottomSheet>
      </VStack>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Bottom sheet with React Native content

Use `RNHostView` to embed React Native components inside the bottom sheet. Set `matchContents` to automatically size the host view to fit its content.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Pressable, Text as RNText, View } from 'react-native';
import { Host, BottomSheet, Button, RNHostView, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { presentationDragIndicator } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function BottomSheetWithRNContentExample() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <VStack>
        <Button label="Open Sheet" onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)} />
        <BottomSheet isPresented={isPresented} onIsPresentedChange={setIsPresented} fitToContents>
          <Group modifiers={[presentationDragIndicator('visible')]}>
            <RNHostView matchContents>
              <View style={{ padding: 24 }}>
                <RNText style={{ fontSize: 18, fontWeight: 'bold', marginBottom: 8 }}>
                  React Native Content
                </RNText>
                <RNText style={{ color: '#666', marginBottom: 16 }}>Counter: {counter}</RNText>
                <Pressable
                  style={{
                    backgroundColor: '#007AFF',
                    padding: 12,
                    borderRadius: 8,
                    alignItems: 'center',
                    marginBottom: 12,
                  }}
                  onPress={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>
                  <RNText style={{ color: 'white', fontWeight: '600' }}>Increment</RNText>
                </Pressable>
                <Pressable
                  style={{
                    backgroundColor: '#FF3B30',
                    padding: 12,
                    borderRadius: 8,
                    alignItems: 'center',
                  }}
                  onPress={() => setIsPresented(false)}>
                  <RNText style={{ color: 'white', fontWeight: '600' }}>Close</RNText>
                </Pressable>
              </View>
            </RNHostView>
          </Group>
        </BottomSheet>
      </VStack>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Bottom sheet with flexible React Native content

When using React Native content with `flex: 1`, omit the `matchContents` prop on `RNHostView` and use [`presentationDetents`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#presentationdetentsdetents-options) to control the sheet height.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Text as RNText, View } from 'react-native';
import { Host, BottomSheet, Button, RNHostView, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { presentationDetents, presentationDragIndicator } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function BottomSheetWithFlexRNContentExample() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <VStack>
        <Button label="Open Sheet" onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)} />
        <BottomSheet isPresented={isPresented} onIsPresentedChange={setIsPresented}>
          <Group
            modifiers={[
              presentationDetents(['medium', 'large']),
              presentationDragIndicator('visible'),
            ]}>
            <RNHostView>
              <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: '#007AFF', padding: 24 }}>
                <RNText style={{ fontSize: 18, fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'white' }}>
                  Flexible React Native Content
                </RNText>
                <RNText style={{ color: 'white', marginTop: 8 }}>
                  This content fills the available space in the sheet.
                </RNText>
              </View>
            </RNHostView>

# Button

A SwiftUI Button component for displaying native buttons.
iOS, tvOS

Expo UI Button matches the official SwiftUI [Button API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/button) and supports styling via the [`buttonStyle`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#buttonstylestyle), [`controlSize`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#controlsizesize), and other modifiers.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Basic button

```tsx
import { Host, Button } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function BasicButtonExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Button label="Press me" onPress={() => alert('Pressed!')} />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Button with system image

```tsx
import { Host, Button } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Button
        label="Download"
        systemImage="arrow.down.circle"
        onPress={() => alert('Downloading...')}
      />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Icon-only button

        modifiers={[labelStyle('iconOnly')]}
        onPress={() => alert('Settings')}
      />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Button styles

Use the `buttonStyle` modifier to change the button's appearance. Available styles are: `bordered`, `borderedProminent`, `borderless`, `plain`, `glass`, and `glassProminent`.

        <Button label="Delete" role="destructive" />
      </VStack>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Button label="Disabled" modifiers={[disabled()]} />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

packageName: '@expo/ui'
platforms: ['ios', 'tvos']

# ConfirmationDialog

A SwiftUI ConfirmationDialog component for presenting confirmation prompts.
iOS, tvOS

Expo UI ConfirmationDialog matches the official SwiftUI [confirmationDialog API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/confirmationdialog\(_:ispresented:titlevisibility:actions:message:\)) and presents an action sheet-style dialog with a title, actions, and an optional message.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Basic confirmation dialog

Use `ConfirmationDialog.Trigger` to define the visible element and `ConfirmationDialog.Actions` to provide the dialog buttons.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, ConfirmationDialog, Button, Text } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function BasicConfirmationDialogExample() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <ConfirmationDialog
        title="Are you sure?"
        isPresented={isPresented}
        onIsPresentedChange={setIsPresented}
        titleVisibility="visible">
        <ConfirmationDialog.Trigger>
          <Button label="Show Dialog" onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)} />
        </ConfirmationDialog.Trigger>
        <ConfirmationDialog.Actions>
          <Button label="Confirm" onPress={() => setIsPresented(false)} />
          <Button label="Cancel" role="cancel" />
        </ConfirmationDialog.Actions>
      </ConfirmationDialog>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Destructive action confirmation

Use `role="destructive"` on a `Button` inside `ConfirmationDialog.Actions` to style it as a destructive action.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, ConfirmationDialog, Button, Text } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function DestructiveConfirmationDialogExample() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <ConfirmationDialog
        title="Delete Item?"
        isPresented={isPresented}
        onIsPresentedChange={setIsPresented}
        titleVisibility="visible">
        <ConfirmationDialog.Trigger>
          <Button label="Delete" role="destructive" onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)} />
        </ConfirmationDialog.Trigger>
        <ConfirmationDialog.Actions>
          <Button
            label="Delete"
            role="destructive"
            onPress={() => {
              console.log('Deleted');
              setIsPresented(false);
            }}
          />
          <Button label="Cancel" role="cancel" />
        </ConfirmationDialog.Actions>
        <ConfirmationDialog.Message>
          <Text>This action cannot be undone.</Text>
        </ConfirmationDialog.Message>
      </ConfirmationDialog>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### With message and multiple actions

Use `ConfirmationDialog.Message` to display a descriptive message below the title, and include multiple action buttons for different choices.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, ConfirmationDialog, Button, Text } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function MultiActionConfirmationDialogExample() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <ConfirmationDialog
        title="Save Changes?"
        isPresented={isPresented}
        onIsPresentedChange={setIsPresented}
        titleVisibility="visible">
        <ConfirmationDialog.Trigger>
          <Button label="Close Document" onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)} />
        </ConfirmationDialog.Trigger>
        <ConfirmationDialog.Actions>
          <Button label="Save" onPress={() => console.log('Saved')} />
          <Button label="Discard" role="destructive" onPress={() => console.log('Discarded')} />
          <Button label="Cancel" role="cancel" />
        </ConfirmationDialog.Actions>
        <ConfirmationDialog.Message>
          <Text>You have unsaved changes. What would you like to do?</Text>
        </ConfirmationDialog.Message>
      </ConfirmationDialog>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Hidden title

Set `titleVisibility="hidden"` to hide the dialog title while still showing the actions and message. You should still provide a `title` for accessibility.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, ConfirmationDialog, Button, Text } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function HiddenTitleConfirmationDialogExample() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <ConfirmationDialog
        title="Hidden Title"
        isPresented={isPresented}
        onIsPresentedChange={setIsPresented}
        titleVisibility="hidden">
        <ConfirmationDialog.Trigger>
          <Button label="Show Dialog" onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)} />
        </ConfirmationDialog.Trigger>
        <ConfirmationDialog.Actions>
          <Button label="OK" onPress={() => setIsPresented(false)} />
          <Button label="Cancel" role="cancel" />
        </ConfirmationDialog.Actions>
        <ConfirmationDialog.Message>
          <Text>Only the message and actions are visible.</Text>
        </ConfirmationDialog.Message>
      </ConfirmationDialog>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

```tsx
import { ConfirmationDialog } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
```

# Group

A SwiftUI Group component for grouping views without affecting layout.
iOS, tvOS

Expo UI Group matches the official SwiftUI [Group API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/group) and groups views together without introducing additional layout structure.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Basic group

Groups are useful for applying modifiers to multiple views at once or organizing views without affecting layout.

```tsx
import { Host, Group, Text } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { foregroundStyle } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function BasicGroupExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Group modifiers={[foregroundStyle({ color: 'blue' })]}>
        <Text>First item</Text>
        <Text>Second item</Text>
        <Text>Third item</Text>
      </Group>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

## API

```tsx
import { Group } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
```

## Component

### `Group`

Supported platforms: iOS, tvOS.

Type: React.[Element](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#function-component)<[GroupProps](#groupprops)\>

GroupProps

### `children`

Supported platforms: iOS, tvOS.

Type: [ReactNode](https://reactnative.dev/docs/react-node)

packageName: '@expo/ui'
platforms: ['ios', 'tvos']
---

# Host

A SwiftUI Host component that enables SwiftUI components in React Native.
iOS, tvOS

A component that allows you to put the other `@expo/ui/swift-ui` components in React Native. It acts like [`<svg>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/svg) for DOM, [`<Canvas>`](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia/docs/canvas/overview/) for [`react-native-skia`](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia/), which underlying uses [`UIHostingController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uihostingcontroller) to render the SwiftUI views in UIKit.

Since the `Host` component is a React Native [`View`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view), you can pass the [`style`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/style) prop to it or `matchContents` prop to make the `Host` component match the contents' size.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Match contents sizing

Use `matchContents` to let the `Host` automatically size itself to fit its SwiftUI content, instead of requiring explicit dimensions.

```tsx
import { Button, Host } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function MatchContentsExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Button
        onPress={() => {
          console.log('Pressed');
        }}>
        Click
      </Button>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Explicit sizing with style

Use `style` to set explicit sizes on the `Host`, such as filling the available space with `flex: 1`.

```tsx
import { Button, Host, VStack, Text } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function ExplicitSizingExample() {
  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <VStack spacing={8}>
        <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
        <Button
          onPress={() => {
            console.log('Pressed');
          }}>
          Click
        </Button>
      </VStack>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Ignoring keyboard safe area

Use `ignoreSafeArea="keyboard"` when React Native is already handling keyboard avoidance (for example, with `react-native-keyboard-controller`), to prevent the SwiftUI host from applying its own keyboard inset.

```tsx
import { Host, TextField } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { KeyboardProvider, KeyboardStickyView } from 'react-native-keyboard-controller';
import { View } from 'react-native';

export default function IgnoreKeyboardExample() {
  return (
    <KeyboardProvider>
      <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'black' }}>
        <KeyboardStickyView
          style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            bottom: 0,
            left: 0,
            right: 0,
            padding: 16,
            backgroundColor: 'green',
          }}>
          <Host matchContents ignoreSafeArea="keyboard" style={{ backgroundColor: 'red' }}>
            <TextField placeholder="Enter text" multiline />
          </Host>
        </KeyboardStickyView>
      </View>
    </KeyboardProvider>
  );
}
```

### Ignoring all safe areas

Use `ignoreSafeArea="all"` when you want SwiftUI content to extend behind the status bar, useful for full-screen overlays or backgrounds.

```tsx
import { Host, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function IgnoreAllSafeAreasExample() {
  return (
    <Host
      ignoreSafeArea="all"
      style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0 }}>
      <VStack>
        <Text>This content extends behind the status bar and home indicator.</Text>
      </VStack>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

# SwiftUI

SwiftUI components for building native iOS interfaces with @expo/ui.
iOS, tvOS

> **This library is currently in beta and subject to breaking changes.** It is not available in the Expo Go app — use [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction) to try it out.

The SwiftUI components in `@expo/ui/swift-ui` allow you to build fully native iOS interfaces using SwiftUI from React Native.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

Using a component from `@expo/ui/swift-ui` requires wrapping it in a [`Host`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/host) component. The `Host` is a container for SwiftUI views.

```tsx
import { Host, Button } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export function SaveButton() {
  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Button label="Save changes" />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

    </Host>
  );
}
```

### List styles

Use the [`listStyle`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#liststylestyle) modifier to change the list's appearance.

> **Note:** The `inset`, `insetGrouped`, and `sidebar` styles are not available on tvOS.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, List, Text, Section, Picker } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { listStyle, pickerStyle, tag } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

const styles = ['automatic', 'plain', 'inset', 'insetGrouped', 'grouped', 'sidebar'] as const;

export default function ListStylesExample() {
  const [styleIndex, setStyleIndex] = useState(0);

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <List modifiers={[listStyle(styles[styleIndex])]}>
        <Section title="Style Picker">
          <Picker
            label="List Style"
            selection={styleIndex}
            onSelectionChange={setStyleIndex}
            modifiers={[pickerStyle('menu')]}>
            {styles.map((style, index) => (
              <Text key={style} modifiers={[tag(index)]}>
                {style}
              </Text>

          <Text>Item 3</Text>
        </Section>
      </List>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Selection and edit mode

Enable selection, deletion, and reordering of list items using the [`List.ForEach`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/list#listforeach) compound component with `onDelete` and `onMove` props.

-   Use the [`environment`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#environment) modifier to enable edit mode
-   Use the [`tag`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#tagtag) modifier to identify items
-   Use the [`selection`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/list#selection) prop to control selected items
-   Use [`moveDisabled`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#movedisableddisabled) and [`deleteDisabled`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#deletedisableddisabled) modifiers to disable these actions on individual items

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, List, Label, Section, Button, Toggle } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { environment, tag } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

type Task = { id: string; title: string };

const INITIAL_TASKS: Task[] = [
  { id: '1', title: 'Task 1' },
  { id: '2', title: 'Task 2' },
  { id: '3', title: 'Task 3' },
  { id: '4', title: 'Task 4' },
];

export default function EditableListExample() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>(INITIAL_TASKS);
  const [selectedIds, setSelectedIds] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const [editMode, setEditMode] = useState(false);

  const handleDelete = (indices: number[]) => {
    setTasks(prev => prev.filter((_, i) => !indices.includes(i)));
  };

  const handleMove = (sourceIndices: number[], destination: number) => {
    setTasks(prev => {
      const newTasks = [...prev];
      const [removed] = newTasks.splice(sourceIndices[0], 1);
      const adjustedDest = sourceIndices[0] < destination ? destination - 1 : destination;
      newTasks.splice(adjustedDest, 0, removed);
      return newTasks;
    });
  };

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <List
        selection={selectedIds}
        onSelectionChange={ids => setSelectedIds(ids.map(String))}
        modifiers={[environment('editMode', editMode ? 'active' : 'inactive')]}>
        <Section title="Settings">
          <Toggle label="Edit Mode" isOn={editMode} onIsOnChange={setEditMode} />
        </Section>
        <Section title="Tasks">
          <List.ForEach onDelete={handleDelete} onMove={handleMove}>
            {tasks.map(task => (
              <Label key={task.id} title={task.title} modifiers={[tag(task.id)]} />
            ))}
          </List.ForEach>
        </Section>
      </List>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Pull to refresh

Use the [`refreshable`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#refreshablehandler) modifier to enable pull-to-refresh functionality.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, List, Text, Section } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { refreshable } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function RefreshableListExample() {
  const [lastRefresh, setLastRefresh] = useState<Date | null>(null);

  const handleRefresh = async () => {
    // Simulate async data fetching
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
    setLastRefresh(new Date());
  };

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <List modifiers={[refreshable(handleRefresh)]}>
        <Section title="Data">
          <Text>Pull down to refresh</Text>
          {lastRefresh && <Text>Last refresh: {lastRefresh.toLocaleTimeString()}</Text>}
        </Section>
      </List>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Row styling

Use [`listRowBackground`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#listrowbackgroundcolor), [`listRowSeparator`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#listrowseparatorvisibility-edges), and [`listRowInsets`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#listrowinsetsparams) modifiers to customize individual rows.

```tsx
import { Host, List, Text, Section } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { listRowBackground, listRowSeparator, listRowInsets } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function RowStylingExample() {
  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <List>
        <Section title="Styled Rows">
          <Text modifiers={[listRowBackground('blue')]}>Blue background</Text>
          <Text modifiers={[listRowSeparator('hidden')]}>Hidden separator</Text>
          <Text modifiers={[listRowInsets({ leading: 40 })]}>Extra leading inset</Text>
          <Text modifiers={[listRowInsets({ leading: 0, trailing: 0 })]}>No horizontal insets</Text>
        </Section>
      </List>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Keyboard dismiss behavior

Use the [`scrollDismissesKeyboard`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#scrolldismisseskeyboardmode) modifier to control how the keyboard is dismissed when scrolling.

```tsx
import { Host, List, Section, TextField } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { scrollDismissesKeyboard } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function KeyboardDismissExample() {
  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <List modifiers={[scrollDismissesKeyboard('interactively')]}>
        <Section title="Form">
          <TextField placeholder="Name" />
          <TextField placeholder="Email" />
          <TextField placeholder="Phone" />
        </Section>
      </List>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Header prominence

Use the [`headerProminence`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#headerprominenceprominence) modifier to adjust the visual prominence of section headers.

```tsx
import { Host, List, Text, Section } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { headerProminence } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function HeaderProminenceExample() {
  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <List modifiers={[headerProminence('increased')]}>
        <Section title="Important Section">
          <Text>This section has increased header prominence</Text>
        </Section>
        <Section title="Another Section">

# Menu

A SwiftUI Menu component for displaying dropdown menus.
iOS, tvOS

Expo UI Menu matches the official SwiftUI [Menu API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/menu) and supports styling via the [`buttonStyle`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#buttonstylestyle) modifier. Menu opens on a single tap. For long-press interactions, use [`ContextMenu`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/contextmenu) instead.

> **Note:** On tvOS, Menu requires tvOS 17.0 or later.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Simple text label

```tsx
import { Host, Menu, Button } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function SimpleMenuExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Menu label="Options">
        <Button label="Option 1" onPress={() => console.log('Option 1')} />
        <Button label="Option 2" onPress={() => console.log('Option 2')} />
        <Button label="Option 3" onPress={() => console.log('Option 3')} />
      </Menu>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Text label with SF Symbol

```tsx
import { Host, Menu, Button, Divider } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function MenuWithIconExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Menu label="More" systemImage="ellipsis.circle">
        <Button label="Settings" systemImage="gear" onPress={() => console.log('Settings')} />
        <Button label="Profile" systemImage="person" onPress={() => console.log('Profile')} />
        <Divider />
        <Button
          label="Delete"
          role="destructive"
          systemImage="trash"
          onPress={() => console.log('Delete')}
        />
      </Menu>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Custom label

You can pass a React node as the label for custom styling.

```tsx
import { Host, Menu, Button, Text } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function CustomLabelMenuExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Menu label={<Text color="accentColor">Custom Label</Text>}>
        <Button label="Action 1" onPress={() => console.log('Action 1')} />
        <Button label="Action 2" onPress={() => console.log('Action 2')} />
      </Menu>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Nested menu

Menus can be nested to create submenus.

```tsx
import { Host, Menu, Button } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function NestedMenuExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Menu label="Main Menu">
        <Button label="Item 1" onPress={() => console.log('Item 1')} />
        <Menu label="Submenu">
          <Button label="Sub Item 1" onPress={() => console.log('Sub Item 1')} />
          <Button label="Sub Item 2" onPress={() => console.log('Sub Item 2')} />
        </Menu>
        <Button label="Item 2" onPress={() => console.log('Item 2')} />
      </Menu>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### With primary action

When `onPrimaryAction` is provided, a single tap triggers the primary action while a long-press shows the menu.

```tsx
import { Host, Menu, Button } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function PrimaryActionMenuExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Menu
        label="Tap or Hold"
        systemImage="play.circle"
        onPrimaryAction={() => console.log('Primary action triggered!')}>
        <Button label="Menu Item 1" onPress={() => console.log('Menu Item 1')} />
        <Button label="Menu Item 2" onPress={() => console.log('Menu Item 2')} />
        <Button label="Menu Item 3" onPress={() => console.log('Menu Item 3')} />
      </Menu>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Styling with modifiers

You can use the `buttonStyle` modifier to change the appearance of the menu trigger.

```tsx
import { Host, Menu, Button } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { buttonStyle } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function StyledMenuExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Menu label="Styled Menu" modifiers={[buttonStyle('borderedProminent')]}>
        <Button label="Styled Action 1" onPress={() => console.log('Styled 1')} />
        <Button label="Styled Action 2" onPress={() => console.log('Styled 2')} />
      </Menu>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Icon only menu button

Use the `labelStyle('iconOnly')` modifier to display only the icon without the label text. The `label` prop should still be provided for accessibility purposes.

```tsx
import { Host, Menu, Button } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { labelStyle } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function IconOnlyMenuExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>

# Modifiers

SwiftUI view modifiers for customizing component appearance and behavior.
iOS, tvOS

SwiftUI view modifiers that allow you to customize the appearance and behavior of UI components.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

Modifiers are applied to components using the `modifiers` prop with an array syntax. You can combine multiple modifiers to create complex styling and behavior.

```tsx
import { Text, Host, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import {
  background,
  cornerRadius,
  padding,
  shadow,
  foregroundColor,
  onTapGesture,
} from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

function ModifiersExample() {
  const [isEnabled, setIsEnabled] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <VStack spacing={20}>
        {/* Basic styling modifiers */}
        <Text
          modifiers={[
            background('#FF6B6B'),
            cornerRadius(12),
            padding({ all: 16 }),
            foregroundColor('#FFFFFF'),
          ]}>
          Basic styled text
        </Text>

        {/* Complex combination with shadow and interaction */}
        <Text
          modifiers={[
            background('#4ECDC4'),
            cornerRadius(16),
            padding({ horizontal: 20, vertical: 12 }),
            shadow({ radius: 4, x: 0, y: 2, color: '#4ECDC440' }),
            onTapGesture(() => console.log('Tapped!')),
          ]}>
          Styled with shadow and tap gesture
        </Text>

        {/* Conditional modifiers using spread operator */}
        <Text
          modifiers={[
            background('#9B59B6'),
            cornerRadius(8),
            padding({ all: 14 }),
            ...(isEnabled
              ? [shadow({ radius: 6, y: 3 }), scaleEffect(1.02)]
              : [grayscale(0.5), opacity(0.7)]),
          ]}>
          Conditional styling
        </Text>
      </VStack>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

> You can also create custom modifiers that work with any Expo UI component. See the [Extending with SwiftUI](/guides/expo-ui-swift-ui/extending) guide for details.

# Namespace

A Namespace component that allows you create Namespaces in SwiftUI
iOS, tvOS

A Namespace component that allows you to create SwiftUI [Namespaces](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/namespace) for coordinating animations and matched geometry effects between views.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

Namespaces are used to coordinate animations and matched geometry effects between views. They provide a unique identifier that can be shared across components to create smooth transitions.

```tsx
import {
  Host,
  HStack,
  GlassEffectContainer,

# Popover

A SwiftUI Popover component for displaying content in a floating overlay.
iOS

Expo UI Popover matches the official SwiftUI [Popover API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/popover\(ispresented:attachmentanchor:arrowedge:content:\)) and provides a way to present content in a floating overlay anchored to a trigger element.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Basic popover

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, Button, Popover, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { padding } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function BasicPopoverExample() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Popover
        isPresented={isPresented}
        onStateChange={({ isPresented }) => setIsPresented(isPresented)}>
        <Popover.Trigger>
          <Button onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)}>Show Popover</Button>
        </Popover.Trigger>
        <Popover.Content>
          <VStack modifiers={[padding({ all: 16 })]}>
            <Text>Hello from Popover!</Text>
          </VStack>
        </Popover.Content>
      </Popover>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### With attachment anchor

The `attachmentAnchor` prop controls where the popover attaches to the trigger element. Available options are: `center`, `leading`, `trailing`, `top`, and `bottom`.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, Button, Popover, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { padding } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function AttachmentAnchorExample() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Popover
        isPresented={isPresented}
        onStateChange={({ isPresented }) => setIsPresented(isPresented)}
        attachmentAnchor="trailing">
        <Popover.Trigger>
          <Button onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)}>Show Popover</Button>
        </Popover.Trigger>
        <Popover.Content>
          <VStack modifiers={[padding({ all: 16 })]}>
            <Text>Attached to trailing edge</Text>
          </VStack>
        </Popover.Content>
      </Popover>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### With arrow edge

The `arrowEdge` prop controls which edge of the popover displays the arrow. Available options are: `none`, `leading`, `trailing`, `top`, and `bottom`.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, Button, Popover, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { padding } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function ArrowEdgeExample() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Popover
        isPresented={isPresented}
        onStateChange={({ isPresented }) => setIsPresented(isPresented)}
        arrowEdge="top">

          </VStack>
        </Popover.Content>
      </Popover>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### With React Native content

# ProgressView

A SwiftUI ProgressView component for displaying progress indicators.
iOS, tvOS

Expo UI ProgressView matches the official SwiftUI [ProgressView API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/progressview) and supports styling via the [`progressViewStyle`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#progressviewstylestyle) modifier.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Indeterminate progress

When no `value` is provided, the progress view displays an indeterminate indicator (spinner).

```tsx
import { Host, ProgressView } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function IndeterminateExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <ProgressView />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Determinate progress

Provide a `value` between `0` and `1` to show determinate progress.

```tsx
import { Host, ProgressView } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function DeterminateExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <ProgressView value={0.5} />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Progress view styles

Use the [`progressViewStyle`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#progressviewstylestyle) modifier to change the progress view's appearance. Available styles are: `automatic`, `linear`, and `circular`.

```tsx
import { Host, ProgressView, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { progressViewStyle } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function ProgressViewStylesExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <ProgressView value={0.5} modifiers={[progressViewStyle('linear')]} />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### With label

You can pass custom components as `children` to provide a label for the progress view.

```tsx
import { Host, ProgressView, Text } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function LabelExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <ProgressView value={0.25}>
        <Text>Loading...</Text>
      </ProgressView>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Tinted progress view

Use the `tint` modifier to change the progress view's color.

```tsx
import { Host, ProgressView } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { tint } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function TintedExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <ProgressView value={0.7} modifiers={[tint('red')]} />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Timer-based progress

Use the `timerInterval` prop to create a progress view that automatically animates over a time range. This is useful for showing countdown timers or timed operations.

> **Note:** Timer-based progress is only available on iOS 16+ and tvOS 16+.

```tsx
import { Host, ProgressView, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function TimerExample() {
  const startDate = new Date();
  const endDate = new Date(Date.now() + 10000); // 10 seconds from now

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <VStack spacing={16}>
        <ProgressView timerInterval={{ lower: startDate, upper: endDate }} />
        <ProgressView timerInterval={{ lower: startDate, upper: endDate }} countsDown={false}>
          <Text>Counting up</Text>
        </ProgressView>
      </VStack>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

## API

```tsx
import { ProgressView } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
```

# RNHostView

A component that enables React Native views inside SwiftUI.
iOS, tvOS

A component that enables proper layout behavior when React Native views are rendered inside SwiftUI components. It syncs layout information from SwiftUI back to React Native's Yoga layout system by updating the shadow node size.

When React Native views are placed inside SwiftUI components like [`BottomSheet`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/bottomsheet), [`Popover`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/popover) or [`HStack`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/hstack) and so on, the layout systems need to communicate. `RNHostView` bridges this gap:

-   **With `matchContents`**: The shadow node size is set to match the child React Native view's intrinsic size, allowing the SwiftUI parent to size itself based on the React Native content.
-   **Without `matchContents`**: The shadow node size is set to match the parent SwiftUI view's size, allowing the React Native content to fill the available space (useful for `flex: 1` layouts).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Basic usage with matchContents

Use `matchContents` when you want the SwiftUI parent to size itself based on the React Native content.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Pressable, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { Host, BottomSheet, Button, RNHostView } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

function Example() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Button label="Open Sheet" onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)} />
      <BottomSheet isOpened={isPresented} onIsOpenedChange={setIsPresented}>
        <RNHostView matchContents>
          <View style={{ padding: 24 }}>
            <Text style={{ fontSize: 18, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>React Native Content</Text>
            <Pressable
              style={{ backgroundColor: '#007AFF', padding: 12, borderRadius: 8, marginTop: 16 }}
              onPress={() => setIsPresented(false)}>
              <Text style={{ color: 'white', textAlign: 'center' }}>Close</Text>
            </Pressable>
          </View>
        </RNHostView>
      </BottomSheet>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Flexible content without matchContents

When using `flex: 1` in your React Native content, omit the `matchContents` prop so the content fills the available SwiftUI space.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { Host, BottomSheet, Button, RNHostView } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

function Example() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Button label="Open Sheet" onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)} />
      <BottomSheet
        isOpened={isPresented}
        onIsOpenedChange={setIsPresented}
        presentationDetents={['medium', 'large']}>
        <RNHostView>
          <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: '#007AFF', padding: 24 }}>
            <Text style={{ color: 'white', fontSize: 18 }}>
              This content fills the available space
            </Text>
          </View>
        </RNHostView>
      </BottomSheet>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Usage with Popover

`RNHostView` works well inside [`Popover`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/popover) to display interactive React Native content.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Pressable, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { Host, Button, Popover, RNHostView } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

function Example() {
  const [isPresented, setIsPresented] = useState(false);
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Popover isPresented={isPresented} onIsPresentedChange={setIsPresented}>
        <Popover.Trigger>
          <Button onPress={() => setIsPresented(true)} label="Show Popover" />
        </Popover.Trigger>
        <Popover.Content>
          <RNHostView matchContents>
            <View style={{ padding: 24 }}>
              <Text style={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 'bold', marginBottom: 8 }}>
                React Native Content
              </Text>
              <Text style={{ color: '#666', marginBottom: 12 }}>Counter: {counter}</Text>
              <Pressable
                style={{
                  backgroundColor: '#007AFF',
                  padding: 12,
                  borderRadius: 8,
                  alignItems: 'center',
                }}
                onPress={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>
                <Text style={{ color: 'white', fontWeight: '600' }}>Increment</Text>
              </Pressable>
            </View>
          </RNHostView>
        </Popover.Content>
      </Popover>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

# Section

A SwiftUI Section component for grouping content within lists and forms.
iOS, tvOS

Expo UI Section matches the official SwiftUI [Section API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/section) and is used to group related content within [`List`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/list), [`Form`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/form) or [`Picker`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/picker) components.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Basic section with title

Use the `title` prop for simple sections with a text header.

```tsx
import { Host, List, Section, Text } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function BasicSectionExample() {
  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <List>
        <Section title="Settings">
          <Text>General</Text>
          <Text>Privacy</Text>
          <Text>Notifications</Text>
        </Section>
      </List>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Section with custom header and footer

Use the `header` and `footer` props for custom views. These props are only used when `title` is not provided.

```tsx
import { Host, List, Section, Toggle, Text, HStack, Image } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function CustomHeaderFooterExample() {
  const [locationEnabled, setLocationEnabled] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <List>
        <Section
          header={
            <HStack>
              <Image systemName="location.fill" color="blue" size={16} />
              <Text>Location Services</Text>
            </HStack>
          }
          footer={
            <Text>
              Enabling location services allows the app to provide personalized recommendations.
            </Text>
          }>
          <Toggle
            label="Enable Location"
            isOn={locationEnabled}
            onIsOnChange={setLocationEnabled}
          />
        </Section>
      </List>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Collapsible section

Use the `isExpanded` prop to control whether the section is expanded or collapsed. When provided, the section becomes collapsible. Use `onIsExpandedChange` to handle state changes.

> **Note:** Collapsible sections require iOS 17+ and tvOS 17+, and the list must use the `sidebar` style. Footer is not supported for collapsible sections.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, List, Section, Text } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function CollapsibleSectionExample() {
  const [favoritesExpanded, setFavoritesExpanded] = useState(false);
  const [recentsExpanded, setRecentsExpanded] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <List listStyle="sidebar">
        <Section
          title="Favorites"
          isExpanded={favoritesExpanded}
          onIsExpandedChange={setFavoritesExpanded}>
          <Text>Home</Text>
          <Text>Work</Text>
          <Text>Gym</Text>
        </Section>
        <Section
          title="Recents"
          isExpanded={recentsExpanded}
          onIsExpandedChange={setRecentsExpanded}>
          <Text>Coffee Shop</Text>
          <Text>Library</Text>
          <Text>Park</Text>
        </Section>
      </List>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Multiple sections in a form

Sections work within `Form` components to organize form controls into logical groups.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, Form, Section, Toggle, Picker, Text, Button } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { pickerStyle, tag } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function FormSectionsExample() {
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);
  const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState(true);
  const [language, setLanguage] = useState(0);
  const languages = ['English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'German'];

  return (
    <Host style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Form>
        <Section title="Appearance">
          <Toggle label="Dark Mode" isOn={darkMode} onIsOnChange={setDarkMode} />
          <Picker
            label="Language"
            selection={language}
            onSelectionChange={setLanguage}
            modifiers={[pickerStyle('menu')]}>
            {languages.map((lang, index) => (
              <Text key={index} modifiers={[tag(index)]}>
                {lang}
              </Text>
            ))}
          </Picker>
        </Section>
        <Section title="Notifications">
          <Toggle label="Push Notifications" isOn={notifications} onIsOnChange={setNotifications} />
        </Section>
        <Section title="Account">
          <Button label="Sign Out" role="destructive" onPress={() => alert('Signed out')} />
        </Section>
      </Form>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

title: Text
description: A SwiftUI Text component for displaying styled text with support for nested texts.
sourceCodeUrl: 'https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-ui'
packageName: '@expo/ui'
platforms: ['ios', 'tvos']
---

# Text

A SwiftUI Text component for displaying styled text with support for nested texts.
iOS, tvOS

Expo UI Text matches the official SwiftUI [Text API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Basic text

```tsx
import { Host, Text } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function BasicTextExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Text>Hello world</Text>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Text with modifiers

Use modifiers to style the entire text.

```tsx
import { Host, Text } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { font, foregroundStyle } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function StyledTextExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Text modifiers={[font({ size: 24, weight: 'bold' }), foregroundStyle('blue')]}>
        Large Bold Blue Text
      </Text>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Nested text (per-segment styling)

Nest `Text` components to style individual segments differently. This is useful for inline formatting, such as bold or colored words within a sentence.

> **Note:** Nested text uses SwiftUI's [Text concatenation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text), so only modifiers that return `Text` (such as `bold`, `italic`, `font`, `foregroundColor`, and `foregroundStyle` with color) will apply to nested segments.

```tsx
import { Host, Text } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { bold, italic, foregroundStyle } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function NestedTextExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Text>
        Hello <Text modifiers={[bold(), foregroundStyle('red')]}>world</Text>!
      </Text>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Mixed inline styles

Combine multiple styled segments for rich text formatting.

```tsx
import { Host, Text } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { bold, italic, foregroundStyle, font } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function MixedStylesExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Text>
        This is <Text modifiers={[bold()]}>bold</Text>, <Text modifiers={[italic()]}>italic</Text>,
        and <Text modifiers={[foregroundStyle('orange')]}>colored</Text> text.
      </Text>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Font weights

Use the `font` modifier to apply different font weights.

```tsx
import { Host, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { font } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function FontWeightsExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <VStack spacing={4}>
        <Text modifiers={[font({ weight: 'ultraLight' })]}>Ultra Light</Text>
        <Text modifiers={[font({ weight: 'light' })]}>Light</Text>

        <Text modifiers={[font({ weight: 'black' })]}>Black</Text>
      </VStack>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Font designs

Use the `font` modifier to apply different font designs.

```tsx
import { Host, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

      </VStack>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Custom fonts

Use the `font` modifier with a `family` parameter to use custom fonts. You can load custom fonts using [`expo-font`](/versions/latest/sdk/font) library.

```tsx
import { Host, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { font } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';

export default function CustomFontExample() {

  const longText = 'This is a very long text that will be truncated after two lines. '.repeat(5);

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Text modifiers={[lineLimit(2)]}>{longText}</Text>
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Markdown

Use the `markdownEnabled` property to enable Markdown formatting for the text content.

```tsx
import { Host, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function MarkdownTextExample() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <VStack spacing={4}>
        <Text markdownEnabled>Regular text.</Text>
        <Text markdownEnabled>
          This is **bold text**, *italic text* and ***text in both bold and italic***.
        </Text>
        <Text markdownEnabled>~~Strikethrough text~~</Text>
        <Text markdownEnabled>`This is monospaced text`</Text>
        <Text markdownEnabled>

# Toggle

A SwiftUI Toggle component for displaying native toggles.
iOS, tvOS

Expo UI Toggle matches the official SwiftUI [Toggle API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/toggle) and supports styling via the [`toggleStyle`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui/modifiers#togglestylestyle) modifier.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Usage

### Basic toggle

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, Toggle } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function BasicToggleExample() {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Toggle isOn={isOn} onIsOnChange={setIsOn} label="Enable Feature" />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Toggle with system image

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Host, Toggle } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';

export default function ToggleWithImageExample() {
  const [airplaneMode, setAirplaneMode] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Toggle
        isOn={airplaneMode}
        onIsOnChange={setAirplaneMode}
        label="Airplane Mode"
        systemImage="airplane"
      />
    </Host>
  );
}
```

### Toggle styles

Use the `toggleStyle` modifier to change the toggle's appearance. Available styles are: `automatic`, `switch`, and `button`.

> **Note:** The `button` style is not available on tvOS.

title: Updates
description: A library that enables your app to manage remote updates to your application code.

# Expo Updates

A library that enables your app to manage remote updates to your application code.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Included in Expo Go

`expo-updates` is a library that enables your app to manage remote updates to your application code. It communicates with the configured remote update service to get information about available updates.

## Installation

The `expo-updates` library can be automatically configured using [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction), which is a hosted service that manages and serves updates to your app. To get started with EAS Update, follow the instructions in the [Get started](/eas-update/getting-started) guide.

Alternatively, it is also possible to configure the `expo-updates` library manually in cases where a different remote update service is required or configuration is only specified in native files.

Manual installation, configuration, and custom remote update services

```sh
npx expo install expo-updates
```

If you're installing this library in a [bare React Native app](/bare/overview) or a generic app with manually configured native code, follow these [installation instructions](/bare/installing-updates).

If using [app config](/workflow/configuration) for configuration, this library can be configured by setting at least the following app config properties:

-   [`updates.url`](/versions/latest/config/app#updates): a URL of a remote service implementing the [Expo Updates protocol](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1)
-   [`runtimeVersion`](/versions/latest/config/app#runtimeversion): a [runtime version](/versions/latest/sdk/updates#runtime-version)

The remote service must implement the [Expo Updates protocol](/technical-specs/expo-updates-1). [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction) is one such service, but it is also possible to use this library with a custom server.

[Custom Expo Updates Server](https://github.com/expo/custom-expo-updates-server) — Example implementation of a custom server and an app using that server

## Configuration

There are build-time configuration options that control the behavior of the library. For most apps, these configuration values are set in the [app config](/workflow/configuration) under the [`updates` property](/versions/latest/config/app#updates).

| [App config property](/versions/latest/config/app#updates) | Default | Required? | iOS plist/dictionary key | Android meta-data name | Android Map key |

The two core required configuration options are:

-   [`updates.url`](/versions/latest/config/app#updates): the URL at which the library fetches remote updates
-   [`runtimeVersion`](/versions/latest/config/app#runtimeversion): a [runtime version](/versions/latest/sdk/updates#runtime-version)

These are configured automatically when following the EAS Update [Get started](/eas-update/getting-started) guide.

#### Runtime version

Each time you build a binary for your app it includes the native code and configuration present at the time of the build as well as native configuration, and this unique combination is represented by a string called a runtime version. A remote update targets one runtime version, indicating that only binaries with a matching runtime version can load the remote update.

Manual configuration

The runtime version can be managed manually by setting the string value in the config field.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "runtimeVersion": "<runtime_version_string>"
  }
}
```

Automatic configuration using runtime version policies

Runtime version policies derive the runtime version from another piece of information already present in your project. They can be set in the [`runtimeVersion`](/versions/latest/config/app#runtimeversion) config field as follows:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "runtimeVersion": {
      "policy": "<policy_name>"
    }
  }
}
```

Available policy types:

appVersion

The `"appVersion"` policy is provided for projects with that wish to define their runtime compatibility based on the app version.

For example, in a project that has the following in its app config:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "runtimeVersion": {
      "policy": "appVersion"
    },
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "ios": {
      "buildNumber": "1"
    },
    "android": {
      "versionCode": 1
    }
  }
}
```

The `"appVersion"` policy will set the runtime version to the project's current `"version"` property. In this case, the runtime version for the Android and iOS builds and any updates would be `"1.0.0"`.

This policy is great for projects that contain custom native code and that update the `"version"` field after every public release. To submit an app, the app stores require an updated native version number for each submitted build, which makes this policy convenient if you want to be sure that every version installed on user devices has a different runtime version.

When using this policy, you need to manually update `"version"` field in the app config every time there is a public release, but for Play Store's Internal Test Track and the App Store's TestFlight uploads, you can rely on `"autoIncrement"` option in **eas.json** to [manage versions for you](/build-reference/app-versions#remote-version-source).

nativeVersion

The `"nativeVersion"` policy is provided for projects that wish to define their runtime compatibility based on the project's current `"version"` and `"versionCode"` (Android) or `"buildNumber"` (iOS) properties.

For example, in a project that has the following in its app config:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "runtimeVersion": {
      "policy": "nativeVersion"
    },
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "ios": {
      "buildNumber": "1"
    },
    "android": {
      "versionCode": 1
    }
  }
}
```

The runtime version for the Android and iOS builds and any updates would be the combination of `"[version]([buildNumber|versionCode])"`, which in this case would be `"1.0.0(1)"`.

This policy is great for projects containing custom native code that update the native version numbers (`"buildNumber"` for iOS and `"versionCode"` for Android) for each build. To submit an app, the app stores require an updated native version number for each submitted build, which makes this policy convenient if you want to be sure that every app uploaded to the Play Store's Internal Test Track and the App Store's TestFlight distribution tools has a different `runtimeVersion`.

It's important to know that this policy requires management of the native version numbers manually between each build.

Also, if you select a different native version between Android and iOS, you'll end up with builds and updates with separate runtime versions.

fingerprint

The `"fingerprint"` runtime version policy automatically calculates the runtime version for you, including through changes like SDK upgrades or adding custom native code.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "runtimeVersion": {
      "policy": "fingerprint"
    }
  }
}
```

This policy works for both projects with and without custom native code. It works by using the [`@expo/fingerprint`](/versions/latest/sdk/fingerprint) package to calculate the hash of your project during builds and updates to determine build-update compatibility (also known as the runtime).

#### Native configuration and overriding

If your project does not use Continuous Native Generation, these configuration values may also be set in your app's native configuration files or overridden during initialization in native code.

Native configuration instructions

On Android, these options are set as `meta-data` tags in the **AndroidManifest.xml** file (adjacent to the tags added during installation if auto-setup was used). You can also set or override them at runtime using `UpdatesController.overrideConfiguration()`.

On iOS, these properties are set as keys in the **Expo.plist** file. You can also set or override them at runtime by calling `AppController.overrideConfiguration`.

Importing Swift generated headers for use in Objective-C++

If your iOS native code or `AppDelegate.mm` is written in Objective-C++, you will need to add the following imports to reference methods on `EXUpdatesAppController`. This is only necessary for overriding configuration at runtime.

```objc
#import "ExpoModulesCore-Swift.h"
#import "EXUpdatesInterface-Swift.h"
#import "EXUpdates-Swift.h"
```

## Usage

By default, `expo-updates` checks for updates when the app launches. If an update is available, it downloads the update and applies it the next time the app is restarted. You can tune this startup behavior using the `checkAutomatically` and `fallbackToCacheTimeout` configuration options above.

The library also provides a variety of constants to inspect the current update and functions to customize update behavior from your application code (after startup). For example, one common alternative usage pattern is to manually check for updates after the app has started instead of doing the default check on launch.

Example: Check for updates manually

You can configure your app to check for updates manually by doing the following steps:

1.  Set the `checkAutomatically` configuration value to `ON_ERROR_RECOVERY` or `NEVER` to disable the library's default launch behavior.
    
2.  Add the following code to check for available updates, download them, and reload:
    
    ```jsx
    import { View, Button } from 'react-native';
    import * as Updates from 'expo-updates';
    
    function App() {
      async function onFetchUpdateAsync() {
        try {
          const update = await Updates.checkForUpdateAsync();
    
          if (update.isAvailable) {
            await Updates.fetchUpdateAsync();
            await Updates.reloadAsync();
          }
        } catch (error) {
          // You can also add an alert() to see the error message in case of an error when fetching updates.
          alert(`Error fetching latest Expo update: ${error}`);
        }
      }
    
      return (
        <View>
          <Button title="Fetch update" onPress={onFetchUpdateAsync} />
        </View>
      );
    }
    ```

## Testing

Most of the methods and constants in this library can be used or tested only in release builds. In debug builds, the default behavior is to always load the latest JavaScript from a development server. It is possible to [build a debug version of your app with the same updates behavior as a release build](/eas-update/debug-advanced#debugging-of-native-code-while-loading-the-app-through-expo-updates). Such an app will not open the latest JavaScript from your development server — it will load published updates just as a release build does. This may be useful for debugging the behavior of your app when it is not connected to a development server.

**To test the content of an update in a development build**, run [`eas update`](/eas-update/getting-started) and then browse to the update in your development build. Note that this only simulates what an update will look like in your app, and most of the [Updates API](/versions/latest/sdk/updates#api) is unavailable when running in a development build.

**To test updates in a release build**, you can create a [**.apk**](/build-reference/apk) or a [simulator build](/build-reference/simulators), or make a release build locally with `npx expo run:android --variant release` and `npx expo run:ios --configuration Release` (you don't need to submit this build to the store to test). The full [Updates API](/versions/latest/sdk/updates#api) is available in a release build.

**To test the content of an update in Expo Go**, run [`eas update`](/eas-update/getting-started) and then browse to the update in Expo Go. Note that this only simulates what an update will look like in your app, and most of the [Updates API](/versions/latest/sdk/updates#api) is unavailable when running in Expo Go. Also note that only updates using [Expo Go-compatible libraries](/workflow/using-libraries#determining-third-party-library-compatibility) are supported.

## API

```js
import * as Updates from 'expo-updates';
```

## Constants

### `Updates.channel`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: `string | null`

The channel name of the current build, if configured for use with EAS Update. `null` otherwise.

Expo Go and development builds are not set to a specific channel and can run any updates compatible with their native runtime. Therefore, this value will always be `null` when running an update on Expo Go or a development build.

### `Updates.checkAutomatically`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: [UpdatesCheckAutomaticallyValue](#updatescheckautomaticallyvalue) | null

Determines if and when `expo-updates` checks for and downloads updates automatically on startup.

### `Updates.createdAt`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) | null

If `expo-updates` is enabled, this is a `Date` object representing the creation time of the update that's currently running (whether it was embedded or downloaded at runtime).

In development mode, or any other environment in which `expo-updates` is disabled, this value is null.

### `Updates.emergencyLaunchReason`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: `string | null`

If `isEmergencyLaunch` is set to true, this will contain a string error message describing what failed during initialization.

### `Updates.isEmbeddedLaunch`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: `boolean`

This will be true if the currently running update is the one embedded in the build, and not one downloaded from the updates server.

### `Updates.isEmergencyLaunch`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: `boolean`

`expo-updates` does its very best to always launch monotonically newer versions of your app so you don't need to worry about backwards compatibility when you put out an update. In very rare cases, it's possible that `expo-updates` may need to fall back to the update that's embedded in the app binary, even after newer updates have been downloaded and run (an "emergency launch"). This boolean will be `true` if the app is launching under this fallback mechanism and `false` otherwise. If you are concerned about backwards compatibility of future updates to your app, you can use this constant to provide special behavior for this rare case.

### `Updates.isEnabled`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: `boolean`

Whether `expo-updates` is enabled. This may be false in a variety of cases including:

-   enabled set to false in configuration
-   missing or invalid URL in configuration
-   missing runtime version or SDK version in configuration
-   error accessing storage on device during initialization

When false, the embedded update is loaded.

### `Updates.latestContext`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: `UpdatesNativeStateMachineContext`

### `Updates.launchDuration`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: `number | null`

Number of milliseconds it took to launch.

### `Updates.manifest`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: [Partial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#partialtype)<[Manifest](#manifest)\>

If `expo-updates` is enabled, this is the [manifest](/versions/latest/sdk/constants#manifest) (or [classic manifest](/versions/latest/sdk/constants#appmanifest)) object for the update that's currently running.

In development mode, or any other environment in which `expo-updates` is disabled, this object is empty.

### `Updates.runtimeVersion`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: `string | null`

The runtime version of the current build.

### `Updates.updateId`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Type: `string | null`

The UUID that uniquely identifies the currently running update. The UUID is represented in its canonical string form and will always use lowercase letters. This value is `null` when running in a local development environment or any other environment where `expo-updates` is disabled.

Example

`"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"`

## Hooks

### `useUpdates()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Hook that obtains information on available updates and on the currently running update.

Returns: `UseUpdatesReturnType`

Example

```tsx
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';
import * as Updates from 'expo-updates';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { Button, Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function UpdatesDemo() {
  const {
    currentlyRunning,
    isUpdateAvailable,
    isUpdatePending
  } = Updates.useUpdates();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isUpdatePending) {
      // Update has successfully downloaded; apply it now
      Updates.reloadAsync();
    }
  }, [isUpdatePending]);

  // If true, we show the button to download and run the update
  const showDownloadButton = isUpdateAvailable;

  // Show whether or not we are running embedded code or an update
  const runTypeMessage = currentlyRunning.isEmbeddedLaunch
    ? 'This app is running from built-in code'
    : 'This app is running an update';

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.headerText}>Updates Demo</Text>
      <Text>{runTypeMessage}</Text>
      <Button onPress={() => Updates.checkForUpdateAsync()} title="Check manually for updates" />
      {showDownloadButton ? (
        <Button onPress={() => Updates.fetchUpdateAsync()} title="Download and run update" />
      ) : null}
      <StatusBar style="auto" />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Methods

### `Updates.checkForUpdateAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Checks the server to see if a newly deployed update to your project is available. Does not actually download the update. This method cannot be used in development mode, and the returned promise will be rejected if you try to do so.

Checking for an update uses a device's bandwidth and battery life like any network call. Additionally, updates served by Expo may be rate limited. A good rule of thumb to check for updates judiciously is to check when the user launches or foregrounds the app. Avoid polling for updates in a frequent loop.

Returns: `Promise<updatecheckresult>`

A promise that fulfills with an [`UpdateCheckResult`](#updatecheckresult) object.

The promise rejects in Expo Go or if the app is in development mode, or if there is an unexpected error or timeout communicating with the server. It also rejects when `expo-updates` is not enabled.

### `Updates.clearLogEntriesAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Clears existing `expo-updates` log entries.

> For now, this operation does nothing on the client. Once log persistence has been implemented, this operation will actually remove existing logs.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A promise that fulfills if the clear operation was successful.

The promise rejects if there is an unexpected error in clearing the logs.

### `Updates.fetchUpdateAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Downloads the most recently deployed update to your project from server to the device's local storage. This method cannot be used in development mode, and the returned promise will be rejected if you try to do so.

> **Note:** [`reloadAsync()`](#updatesreloadasync) can be called after promise resolution to reload the app using the most recently downloaded version. Otherwise, the update will be applied on the next app cold start.

Returns: `Promise<updatefetchresult>`

A promise that fulfills with an [`UpdateFetchResult`](#updatefetchresult) object.

The promise rejects in Expo Go or if the app is in development mode, or if there is an unexpected error or timeout communicating with the server. It also rejects when `expo-updates` is not enabled.

### `Updates.getExtraParamsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Retrieves the current extra params.

This method cannot be used in Expo Go or development mode. It also rejects when `expo-updates` is not enabled.

Returns: `Promise<record</record`

### `Updates.readLogEntriesAsync(maxAge)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `maxAge`(optional) | `number` | Sets the max age of retrieved log entries in milliseconds. Default to `3600000` ms (1 hour). Default: `3600000` |

  

Retrieves the most recent `expo-updates` log entries.

Returns: `Promise<updateslogentry[]>`

A promise that fulfills with an array of [`UpdatesLogEntry`](#updateslogentry) objects;

The promise rejects if there is an unexpected error in retrieving the logs.

### `Updates.reloadAsync(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | { reloadScreenOptions: [ReloadScreenOptions](#reloadscreenoptions) } |

  

Instructs the app to reload using the most recently downloaded version. This is useful for triggering a newly downloaded update to launch without the user needing to manually restart the app. Unlike `Expo.reloadAppAsync()` provided by the `expo` package, this function not only reloads the app but also changes the loaded JavaScript bundle to that of the most recently downloaded update.

It is not recommended to place any meaningful logic after a call to `await Updates.reloadAsync()`. This is because the promise is resolved after verifying that the app can be reloaded, and immediately before posting an asynchronous task to the main thread to actually reload the app. It is unsafe to make any assumptions about whether any more JS code will be executed after the `Updates.reloadAsync` method call resolves, since that depends on the OS and the state of the native module and main threads.

This method cannot be used in Expo Go or development mode, and the returned promise will be rejected if you try to do so. It also rejects when `expo-updates` is not enabled.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A promise that fulfills right before the reload instruction is sent to the JS runtime, or rejects if it cannot find a reference to the JS runtime. If the promise is rejected in production mode, it most likely means you have installed the module incorrectly. Double check you've followed the installation instructions. In particular, on iOS ensure that you set the `bridge` property on `EXUpdatesAppController` with a pointer to the `RCTBridge` you want to reload, and on Android ensure you either call `UpdatesController.initialize` with the instance of `ReactApplication` you want to reload, or call `UpdatesController.setReactNativeHost` with the proper instance of `ReactNativeHost`.

### `Updates.setExtraParamAsync(key, value)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `key` | `string` |
| `value` | `string | null | undefined` |

  

Sets an extra param if value is non-null, otherwise unsets the param. Extra params are sent as an [Expo Structured Field Value Dictionary](/technical-specs/expo-sfv-0) in the `Expo-Extra-Params` header of update requests. A compliant update server may use these params when selecting an update to serve.

This method cannot be used in Expo Go or development mode. It also rejects when `expo-updates` is not enabled.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

### `Updates.setUpdateRequestHeadersOverride(requestHeaders)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `requestHeaders` | `Record<string, string> | null` |

  

Overrides updates request headers in runtime from build time. This method allows you to load specific updates with custom request headers. Use this method at your own risk, as it may cause unexpected behavior. [Learn more about use cases and limitations](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/override/).

Returns: `void`

### `Updates.setUpdateURLAndRequestHeadersOverride(configOverride)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `configOverride` | `{ requestHeaders: Record<string, string>, updateUrl: string } | null` |

  

Overrides updates URL and reuqest headers in runtime from build time. This method allows you to load specific updates from a URL that you provide. Use this method at your own risk, as it may cause unexpected behavior. Because of the risk, this method requires `disableAntiBrickingMeasures` to be set to `true` in the **app.json** file. [Learn more about use cases and limitations](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/override/).

Returns: `void`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS.

Structure encapsulating information on the currently running app (either the embedded bundle or a downloaded update).

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel(optional) | `string` | The channel name of the current build, if configured for use with EAS Update, `undefined` otherwise. |
| createdAt(optional) | [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) | If `expo-updates` is enabled, this is a `Date` object representing the creation time of the update that's currently running (whether it was embedded or downloaded at runtime).

# Expo VideoThumbnails

A library that allows you to generate an image to serve as a thumbnail from a video file.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Included in Expo Go

> **Deprecated:** Video Thumbnails library has been deprecated in favor of [`generateThumbnailsAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#generatethumbnailsasynctimes-options) from [`expo-video`](/versions/latest/sdk/video). `expo-video-thumbnails` is not receiving patches and will be removed in SDK 56.

`expo-video-thumbnails` allows you to generate an image to serve as a thumbnail from a video file.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-video-thumbnails

  const generateThumbnail = async () => {
    try {
      const { uri } = await VideoThumbnails.getThumbnailAsync(
        'https://d23dyxeqlo5psv.cloudfront.net/big_buck_bunny.mp4',
        {
          time: 15000,
        }
      );
      setImage(uri);
    } catch (e) {
      console.warn(e);
    }
  };

      {image && <Image source={{ uri: image }} style={styles.image} />}
      <Text>{image}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',

# Expo Video (expo-video)

A library that provides an API to implement video playback in apps.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-video` is a cross-platform, performant video component for React Native and Expo with Web support.

#### Known issues 

When two [`VideoView`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#videoview) components are overlapping and have the [`contentFit`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#contentfit) prop set to [`cover`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#videocontentfit), one of the videos may be displayed out of bounds. This is a [known upstream issue](https://github.com/androidx/media/issues/1107). To work around this issue, use the [`surfaceType`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#surfacetype) prop and set it to [`textureView`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#surfacetype-1).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-video
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-video` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-video",
        {
          "supportsBackgroundPlayback": true,
          "supportsPictureInPicture": true
        }
      ]
    ],
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `supportsBackgroundPlayback` | `undefined` | A boolean value to enable background playback support. If `true`, on iOS, the `audio` key is added to the `UIBackgroundModes` array in the **Info.plist** file. If `false`, the key is removed. When `undefined`, the key is not modified. On Android, when `true` adds foreground service permissions and creates a expo-video foreground service in AndroidManifest.xml. |
| `supportsPictureInPicture` | `undefined` | A boolean value to enable Picture-in-Picture on Android and iOS. If `true`, enables the `android:supportsPictureInPicture` property on Android and adds the `audio` key to the `UIBackgroundModes` array in the **Info.plist** file on iOS. If `false`, the key is removed. When `undefined`, the configuration is not modified. |

## Usage

Here's a simple example of a video with a play and pause button.

```jsx
import { useEvent } from 'expo';
import { useVideoPlayer, VideoView } from 'expo-video';
import { StyleSheet, View, Button } from 'react-native';

const videoSource =
  'https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4';

export default function VideoScreen() {
  const player = useVideoPlayer(videoSource, player => {
    player.loop = true;
    player.play();
  });

  const { isPlaying } = useEvent(player, 'playingChange', { isPlaying: player.playing });

  return (
    <View style={styles.contentContainer}>
      <VideoView
        style={styles.video}
        player={player}
        fullScreenOptions={{ allowsFullscreen: true }}
        allowsPictureInPicture
      />
      <View style={styles.controlsContainer}>
        <Button
          title={isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
          onPress={() => {
            if (isPlaying) {
              player.pause();
            } else {
              player.play();
            }
          }}
        />
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  contentContainer: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 10,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    paddingHorizontal: 50,
  },
  video: {
    width: 350,
    height: 275,
  },
  controlsContainer: {
    padding: 10,
  },
});
```

### Receiving events

The changes in properties of the [`VideoPlayer`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#videoplayer) do not update the React state. Therefore, to display the information about the current state of the `VideoPlayer`, it is necessary to listen to the [events](/versions/latest/sdk/video#videoplayerevents) it emits. The event system is based on the [`EventEmitter`](/versions/latest/sdk/expo#eventemitter) class and [hooks](/versions/latest/sdk/expo#hooks) from the [`expo`](/versions/latest/sdk/expo) package. There are a few ways to listen to events:

#### `useEvent` hook

Creates a listener that will return a stateful value that can be used in a component. It also cleans up automatically when the component unmounts.

```tsx
import { useEvent } from 'expo';
// ... Other imports, definition of the component, creating the player etc.

const { status, error } = useEvent(player, 'statusChange', { status: player.status });
// Rest of the component...
```

#### `useEventListener` hook

Built around the `Player.addListener` and `Player.removeListener` methods, creates an event listener with automatic cleanup.

```tsx
import { useEventListener } from 'expo';
// ...Other imports, definition of the component, creating the player etc.

useEventListener(player, 'statusChange', ({ status, error }) => {
  setPlayerStatus(status);
  setPlayerError(error);
  console.log('Player status changed: ', status);
});
// Rest of the component...
```

#### `Player.addListener` method

Most flexible way to listen to events, but requires manual cleanup and more boilerplate code.

```tsx
// ...Imports, definition of the component, creating the player etc.

useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = player.addListener('statusChange', ({ status, error }) => {
    setPlayerStatus(status);
    setPlayerError(error);
    console.log('Player status changed: ', status);
  });

  return () => {
    subscription.remove();
  };
}, []);
// Rest of the component...
```

### Playing local media from the assets directory

`expo-video` supports playing local media loaded using the `require` function. You can use the result as a source directly, or assign it to the `assetId` parameter of a [`VideoSource`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#videosource) if you also want to configure other properties.

```tsx
import { VideoSource } from 'expo-video';

const assetId = require('./assets/bigbuckbunny.mp4');

const videoSource: VideoSource = {
  assetId,
  metadata: {
    title: 'Big Buck Bunny',
    artist: 'The Open Movie Project',
  },
};

const player1 = useVideoPlayer(assetId); // You can use the `asset` directly as a video source
const player2 = useVideoPlayer(videoSource);
```

### Playing media from the media library

`expo-video` supports playing videos picked from user's media library using [`expo-media-library`](/versions/latest/sdk/media-library) or any valid `PHAsset` URI with appropriate permissions.

To play a video from the media library, you should obtain an [`Asset`](/versions/latest/sdk/asset#asset) object with [`MediaLibrary.getAssetsAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/media-library#medialibrarygetassetsasyncassetsoptions) and use its [`uri`](/versions/latest/sdk/asset#uri) property as the [`uri`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#videosource) of the video source. Before playing, make sure to request the necessary permissions using [`MediaLibrary.requestPermissionsAsync()`](/versions/latest/sdk/media-library#medialibraryrequestpermissionsasyncwriteonly-granularpermissions).

On iOS make sure **not** to use the `localUri` property of the asset info, as it does not contain the necessary permissions to read the asset.

```tsx
import * as MediaLibrary from 'expo-media-library';
import { VideoSource, useVideoPlayer, VideoView } from 'expo-video';

// ...Definition of the component, creating the player etc.

const loadAssetAndReplace = async () => {
  const { granted } = await MediaLibrary.requestPermissionsAsync(false, ['video']);
  if (!granted) {
    return;
  }

  const pagedAssets = await MediaLibrary.getAssetsAsync({
    mediaType: 'video',
  });

  if (pagedAssets.assets.length > 0) {
    const [asset] = pagedAssets.assets;
    const videoSource: VideoSource = {
      uri: asset.uri,
      metadata: {
        title: asset.filename,
      },
    };

    await player.replaceAsync(videoSource);
    await player.replaceAsync(asset.uri); // Alternatively you can use the asset uri directly
    player.play();
  }
};

// You can now use loadAssetAndReplace to load and play the first video from the media library
```

### Preloading videos

While another video is playing, a video can be loaded before showing it in the view. This allows for quicker transitions between subsequent videos and a better user experience.

To preload a video, you have to create a `VideoPlayer` with a video source. Even when the player is not connected to a `VideoView`, it will fill the buffers. Once it is connected to the `VideoView`, it will be able to start playing without buffering.

In some cases, it is beneficial to preload a video later in the screen lifecycle. In that case, a `VideoPlayer` with a `null` source should be created. To start preloading, replace the player source with a video source using the `replace()` function.

Here is an example of how to preload a video:

```tsx
import { useVideoPlayer, VideoView, VideoSource } from 'expo-video';
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, TouchableOpacity, View } from 'react-native';

const bigBuckBunnySource: VideoSource =
  'https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4';

const elephantsDreamSource: VideoSource =
  'https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/ElephantsDream.mp4';

export default function PreloadingVideoPlayerScreen() {
  const player1 = useVideoPlayer(bigBuckBunnySource, player => {
    player.play();
  });

  const player2 = useVideoPlayer(elephantsDreamSource, player => {
    player.currentTime = 20;
  });

  const [currentPlayer, setCurrentPlayer] = useState(player1);

  const replacePlayer = useCallback(async () => {
    currentPlayer.pause();
    if (currentPlayer === player1) {
      setCurrentPlayer(player2);
      player1.pause();
      player2.play();
    } else {
      setCurrentPlayer(player1);
      player2.pause();
      player1.play();
    }
  }, [player1, currentPlayer]);

  return (
    <View style={styles.contentContainer}>
      <VideoView player={currentPlayer} style={styles.video} nativeControls={false} />
      <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button} onPress={replacePlayer}>
        <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Replace Player</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  contentContainer: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 10,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    paddingHorizontal: 50,
  },
  button: {
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    borderRadius: 3,
    paddingVertical: 8,
    paddingHorizontal: 12,
    backgroundColor: '#4630ec',
  },
  buttonText: {
    fontSize: 12,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#eeeeee',
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
  video: {
    width: 300,
    height: 168.75,
    marginVertical: 20,
  },
});
```

### Using the VideoPlayer directly

In most cases, the [`useVideoPlayer`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#usevideoplayersource-setup) hook should be used to create a `VideoPlayer` instance. It manages the player's lifecycle and ensures that it is properly disposed of when the component is unmounted. However, in some advanced use cases, it might be necessary to create a `VideoPlayer` that does not get automatically destroyed when the component is unmounted. In those cases, the `VideoPlayer` can be created using the [`createVideoPlayer`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#videocreatevideoplayersource) function. You need be aware of the risks that come with this approach, as it is your responsibility to call the [`release()`](/versions/latest/sdk/expo#release) method when the player is no longer needed. If not handled properly, this approach may lead to memory leaks.

```tsx
import { createVideoPlayer } from 'expo-video';
const player = createVideoPlayer(videoSource);
```

> On Android, mounting multiple `VideoView` components at the same time with the same `VideoPlayer` instance will not work due to a [platform limitation](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/35012).

### Caching videos

If your app frequently replays the same video, caching can be utilized to minimize network usage and enhance user experience, albeit at the cost of increased device storage usage. `expo-video` supports video caching on `Android` and `iOS` platforms. This feature can be activated by setting the [`useCaching`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#videosource) property of a [`VideoSource`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#videosource) object to `true`.

The cache is persistent and will be cleared on a least-recently-used basis once the preferred size is exceeded. Furthermore, the system can clear the cache due to low storage availability, so it's not advisable to depend on the cache to store critical data.

The cache functions offline. If a portion or the entirety of a video is cached, it can be played from the cache even when the device is offline until the cached data is exhausted.

> Due to platform limitations, the cache cannot be used with HLS video sources on iOS. Caching DRM-protected videos is not supported on Android and iOS.

### Managing the cache

-   The preferred cache size in bytes can be defined using the [`setVideoCacheSizeAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#videosetvideocachesizeasyncsizebytes) function. The default cache size is 1GB.
-   The [`getCurrentVideoCacheSize`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#videogetcurrentvideocachesize) can be used to get the current storage occupied by the cache in bytes.
-   All cached videos can be cleared using the [`clearVideoCacheAsync`](/versions/latest/sdk/video#videoclearvideocacheasync) function.

| scrubbingModeEnabled(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: Android, iOS. Whether the codec operating rate should be increased in scrubbing mode. You should only enable this when the player is receiving a large number of seeks in a short period of time. For less frequent seeks, fine-tuning the [`SeekTolerance`](#seektolerance-1) may be sufficient. On Android, the player may consume more resources in this mode, so it should only be used for short periods of time in response to user interaction (for example, dragging on a progress bar UI element). On Android, when `scrubbingModeEnabled` is `true`, the playback is suppressed. You should set this property back to `false` when the user interaction ends to allow the playback to resume. For best results, on iOS you should pause the playback when scrubbing. For best scrubbing performance, consider also increasing the seeking tolerance using the SeekTolerance property. Other scrubbing mode options will have no effect when this is false. Default: `false` |
| useDecodeOnlyFlag(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: Android. Sets whether to use `MediaCodec.BUFFER_FLAG_DECODE_ONLY` in scrubbing mode. When playback is using MediaCodec on API 34+, this flag can speed up seeking by signalling that the decoded output of buffers between the previous keyframe and the target frame is not needed by the player. Default: `true` |

### `SeekTolerance`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Determines the time that the actual position seeked to may precede or exceed the requested seek position. Larger tolerance will usually result in faster seeking. This property affects the precision of setting the [`currentTime`](#currenttime) property and the [`seekBy`](#seekbyseconds) method, and on Android, it also affects the accuracy of the scrubber from the default native controls.

> If you are trying to optimize for scrubbing (many frequent seeks), also see [`ScrubbingModeOptions`](#scrubbingmodeoptions-1).

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| toleranceAfter(optional) | `number` | The maximum time that the actual position seeked to may exceed the requested seek position, in seconds. Must be non-negative. Default: `0` |

# react-native-pager-view

A component library that provides a carousel-like view to swipe through pages of content.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

`react-native-pager-view` exposes a component that provides the layout and gestures to scroll between pages of content, like a carousel.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install react-native-pager-view
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project. Then, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-pager-view#linking) provided in the library's README or documentation.

## Example

```jsx
import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from 'react-native';
import PagerView from 'react-native-pager-view';

export default function MyPager() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <PagerView style={styles.container} initialPage={0}>
        <View style={styles.page} key="1">
          <Text>First page</Text>
          <Text>Swipe ➡️</Text>
        </View>
        <View style={styles.page} key="2">

# Expo WebBrowser

A library that provides access to the system's web browser and supports handling redirects.
Android, iOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

`expo-web-browser` provides access to the system's web browser and supports handling redirects. On Android, it uses `ChromeCustomTabs` and on iOS, it uses `SFSafariViewController` or `ASWebAuthenticationSession`, depending on the method you call. As of iOS 11, `SFSafariViewController` no longer shares cookies with Safari, so if you are using `WebBrowser` for authentication you will want to use `WebBrowser.openAuthSessionAsync`, and if you just want to open a webpage (such as your app privacy policy), then use `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync`.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-web-browser
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-web-browser` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

## Usage

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Button, Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import * as WebBrowser from 'expo-web-browser';

export default function App() {
  const [result, setResult] = useState(null);

  const _handlePressButtonAsync = async () => {
    let result = await WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync('https://expo.dev');
    setResult(result);
  };
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Open WebBrowser" onPress={_handlePressButtonAsync} />
      <Text>{result && JSON.stringify(result)}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    paddingTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,
    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',
  },
});
```

### Handling deep links from the WebBrowser

If your project uses Expo Router, deep links are handled automatically.

## API

```js
import * as WebBrowser from 'expo-web-browser';
```

## Methods

### `WebBrowser.coolDownAsync(browserPackage)`

Supported platforms: Android.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `browserPackage`(optional) | `string` | Package of browser to be cooled. If not set, preferred browser will be used. |

  

This methods removes all bindings to services created by [`warmUpAsync`](#webbrowserwarmupasyncbrowserpackage) or [`mayInitWithUrlAsync`](#webbrowsermayinitwithurlasyncurl-browserpackage). You should call this method once you don't need them to avoid potential memory leaks. However, those binding would be cleared once your application is destroyed, which might be sufficient in most cases.

Returns: `Promise<serviceactionresult>`

The promise which fulfils with `WebBrowserCoolDownResult` when cooling is performed, or an empty object when there was no connection to be dismissed.

### `WebBrowser.dismissAuthSession()`

Supported platforms: iOS, Web.

Dismisses the current authentication session. On web, it will close the popup window associated with auth process.

Returns: `void`

The `void` on the successful attempt or throws an error if dismiss functionality is not available.

### `WebBrowser.dismissBrowser()`

Supported platforms: iOS.

Dismisses the presented web browser.

Returns: `Promise<{ type: DISMISS }>`

The promise that resolves with `{ type: 'dismiss' }` on the successful attempt or throws an error if dismiss functionality is not available.

### `WebBrowser.getCustomTabsSupportingBrowsersAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android.

Returns a list of applications package names supporting Custom Tabs, Custom Tabs service, user chosen and preferred one. This may not be fully reliable, since it uses `PackageManager.getResolvingActivities` under the hood. (For example, some browsers might not be present in browserPackages list once another browser is set to default.)

Returns: `Promise<webbrowsercustomtabsresults>`

The promise which fulfils with [`WebBrowserCustomTabsResults`](#webbrowsercustomtabsresults) object.

### `WebBrowser.maybeCompleteAuthSession(options)`

Supported platforms: Web.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | [WebBrowserCompleteAuthSessionOptions](#webbrowsercompleteauthsessionoptions) |

  

Possibly completes an authentication session on web in a window popup. The method should be invoked on the page that the window redirects to.

Returns: `WebBrowserCompleteAuthSessionResult`

Returns an object with message about why the redirect failed or succeeded:

If `type` is set to `failed`, the reason depends on the message:

-   `Not supported on this platform`: If the platform doesn't support this method (Android, iOS).
-   `Cannot use expo-web-browser in a non-browser environment`: If the code was executed in an SSR or node environment.
-   `No auth session is currently in progress`: (the cached state wasn't found in local storage). This can happen if the window redirects to an origin (website) that is different to the initial website origin. If this happens in development, it may be because the auth started on localhost and finished on your computer port (Ex: `128.0.0.*`). This is controlled by the `redirectUrl` and `returnUrl`.
-   `Current URL "<URL>" and original redirect URL "<URL>" do not match`: This can occur when the redirect URL doesn't match what was initial defined as the `returnUrl`. You can skip this test in development by passing `{ skipRedirectCheck: true }` to the function.

If `type` is set to `success`, the parent window will attempt to close the child window immediately.

If the error `ERR_WEB_BROWSER_REDIRECT` was thrown, it may mean that the parent window was reloaded before the auth was completed. In this case you'll need to close the child window manually.

### `WebBrowser.mayInitWithUrlAsync(url, browserPackage)`

Supported platforms: Android.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | `string` | The url of page that is likely to be loaded first when opening browser. |
| `browserPackage`(optional) | `string` | Package of browser to be informed. If not set, preferred browser will be used. |

  

This method initiates (if needed) [CustomTabsSession](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/customtabs/CustomTabsSession.html#maylaunchurl) and calls its `mayLaunchUrl` method for browser specified by the package.

Returns: `Promise<serviceactionresult>`

A promise which fulfils with `WebBrowserMayInitWithUrlResult` object.

### `WebBrowser.openAuthSessionAsync(url, redirectUrl, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | `string` | The url to open in the web browser. This should be a login page. |
| `redirectUrl`(optional) | `string | null` | _Optional_ - The url to deep link back into your app. On web, this defaults to the output of [`Linking.createURL("")`](/versions/latest/sdk/linking#linkingcreateurlpath-namedparameters). |
| `options`(optional) | [AuthSessionOpenOptions](/versions/latest/sdk/webbrowser#authsessionopenoptions) | _Optional_ - An object extending the [`WebBrowserOpenOptions`](#webbrowseropenoptions). If there is no native AuthSession implementation available (which is the case on Android) these params will be used in the browser polyfill. If there is a native AuthSession implementation, these params will be ignored. Default: `{}` |

  

#### On Android:

This will be done using a "custom Chrome tabs" browser, [AppState](https://reactnative.dev/docs/appstate), and [Linking](/versions/latest/sdk/linking) APIs.

#### On iOS:

Opens the url with Safari in a modal using `ASWebAuthenticationSession`. The user will be asked whether to allow the app to authenticate using the given url. To handle redirection back to the mobile application, the redirect URI set in the authentication server has to use the protocol provided as the scheme in **app.json** [`expo.scheme`](/versions/latest/config/app#scheme). For example, `demo://` not `https://` protocol. Using `Linking.addEventListener` is not needed and can have side effects.

#### On web:

> This API can only be used in a secure environment (localhost/https). to test this. Otherwise, an error with code [`ERR_WEB_BROWSER_CRYPTO`](#err_web_browser_crypto) will be thrown. This will use the browser's [`window.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open) API.

-   _Desktop_: This will create a new web popup window in the browser that can be closed later using `WebBrowser.maybeCompleteAuthSession()`.
-   _Mobile_: This will open a new tab in the browser which can be closed using `WebBrowser.maybeCompleteAuthSession()`.

How this works on web:

-   A crypto state will be created for verifying the redirect.
    -   This means you need to run with `npx expo start --https`
-   The state will be added to the window's `localstorage`. This ensures that auth cannot complete unless it's done from a page running with the same origin as it was started. Ex: if `openAuthSessionAsync` is invoked on `https://localhost:19006`, then `maybeCompleteAuthSession` must be invoked on a page hosted from the origin `https://localhost:19006`. Using a different website, or even a different host like `https://128.0.0.*:19006` for example will not work.
-   A timer will be started to check for every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) to detect if the window has been closed by the user. If this happens then a promise will resolve with `{ type: 'dismiss' }`.

> On mobile web, Chrome and Safari will block any call to [`window.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open) which takes too long to fire after a user interaction. This method must be invoked immediately after a user interaction. If the event is blocked, an error with code [`ERR_WEB_BROWSER_BLOCKED`](#err_web_browser_blocked) will be thrown.

Returns: `Promise<webbrowserauthsessionresult>`

-   If the user does not permit the application to authenticate with the given url, the Promise fulfills with `{ type: 'cancel' }` object.
-   If the user closed the web browser, the Promise fulfills with `{ type: 'cancel' }` object.
-   If the browser is closed using [`dismissBrowser`](#webbrowserdismissbrowser), the Promise fulfills with `{ type: 'dismiss' }` object.

### `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync(url, browserParams)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | `string` | The url to open in the web browser. |
| `browserParams`(optional) | [WebBrowserOpenOptions](/versions/latest/sdk/webbrowser#webbrowseropenoptions) | A dictionary of key-value pairs. Default: `{}` |

  

Opens the url with Safari in a modal on iOS using [`SFSafariViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller), and Chrome in a new [custom tab](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs) on Android. On iOS, the modal Safari will not share cookies with the system Safari. If you need this, use [`openAuthSessionAsync`](#webbrowseropenauthsessionasyncurl-redirecturl-options).

Returns: `Promise<webbrowserresult>`

The promise behaves differently based on the platform. On Android promise resolves with `{ type: 'opened' }` if we were able to open browser. On iOS:

-   If the user closed the web browser, the Promise resolves with `{ type: 'cancel' }`.
-   If the browser is closed using [`dismissBrowser`](#webbrowserdismissbrowser), the Promise resolves with `{ type: 'dismiss' }`.

### `WebBrowser.warmUpAsync(browserPackage)`

Supported platforms: Android.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `browserPackage`(optional) | `string` | Package of browser to be warmed up. If not set, preferred browser will be warmed. |

  

This method calls the `warmUp` method on [CustomTabsClient](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/customtabs/CustomTabsClient.html#warmup\(long\)) for specified package.

Returns: `Promise<serviceactionresult>`

A promise which fulfils with `WebBrowserWarmUpResult` object.

## Types

### `AuthSessionOpenOptions`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web.

## Error codes

### `ERR_WEB_BROWSER_REDIRECT`

**Web only:** The window cannot complete the redirect request because the invoking window doesn't have a reference to its parent. This can happen if the parent window was reloaded.

### `ERR_WEB_BROWSER_BLOCKED`

**Web only:** The popup window was blocked by the browser or failed to open. This can happen in mobile browsers when the `window.open()` method was invoked too long after a user input was fired.

Mobile browsers do this to prevent malicious websites from opening many unwanted popups on mobile.

You're method can still run in an async function but there cannot be any long running tasks before it. You can use hooks to disable user-inputs until any other processes have finished loading.

### `ERR_WEB_BROWSER_CRYPTO`

**Web only:** The current environment doesn't support crypto. Ensure you are running from a secure origin (localhost/https).

title: Widgets
description: A library to build iOS home screen widgets and Live Activities using Expo UI components.
sourceCodeUrl: 'https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-widgets'
packageName: 'expo-widgets'
platforms: ['ios']
isAlpha: true
---

# Expo Widgets

A library to build iOS home screen widgets and Live Activities using Expo UI components.
iOS

> This library is currently in alpha and subject to breaking changes. It is not available in the Expo Go app, use [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction) to try it out.

`expo-widgets` enables the creation of iOS home screen widgets and Live Activities using Expo UI components, without writing native code. It provides a simple API for creating and updating widgets timeline, as well as starting and managing Live Activities. Layout can be built using [`expo/ui`](/versions/latest/sdk/ui/swift-ui) components and modifiers.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-widgets
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-widgets` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-widgets",
        {
          "widgets": [
            {
              "name": "MyWidget",
              "displayName": "My Widget",
              "description": "A sample home screen widget",
              "supportedFamilies": ["systemSmall", "systemMedium", "systemLarge"]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |

| `groupIdentifier` | `"group.<app bundle identifier>"` | The app group identifier used for communication and data sharing between the main app and widgets. This is required for widgets to work properly. If not specified, defaults to `group.<main app bundle identifier>`. |
| `enablePushNotifications` | `false` | Whether to enable push notifications for Live Activities. When enabled, this adds the `aps-environment` entitlement and sets `ExpoLiveActivity_EnablePushNotifications` in the **Info.plist**. |
| `widgets` | - | An array of widget configurations. Each widget in the array will be generated as a separate widget kind in your widget extension. |
| `widgets[].name` | - | The internal name (identifier) of the widget. This is used as the Swift struct name and should be a valid Swift identifier (no spaces or special characters). |
| `widgets[].displayName` | - | The user-facing name of the widget that appears in the widget gallery when users add widgets to their home screen. |
| `widgets[].description` | - | A brief description of what the widget does. This appears in the widget gallery to help users understand the widget's purpose. |
| `widgets[].supportedFamilies` | - | An array of widget sizes that this widget supports. Available options:
-   `systemSmall` - Small square widget (2x2 grid)
-   `systemMedium` - Medium rectangular widget (4x2 grid)
-   `systemLarge` - Large square widget (4x4 grid)
-   `systemExtraLarge` - Extra large widget (iPad only, 6x4 grid)

        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Widgets

#### Prerequisite: Creating widget

Start by creating a Widget using the `createWidget` function and pass the widget component marked with the `'widget'` directive.

```tsx
import { Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { font, foregroundStyle } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';
import { createWidget, WidgetBase } from 'expo-widgets';

type MyWidgetProps = {
  count: number;
};

const MyWidget = (props: WidgetBase<MyWidgetProps>) => {
  'widget';
  return (
    <VStack>
      <Text modifiers={[font({ weight: 'bold', size: 16 }), foregroundStyle('#000000')]}>
        Count: {props.count}
      </Text>
    </VStack>
  );
};

export default createWidget('MyWidget', MyWidget);
```

The widget name (`'MyWidget'`) must match the `name` field in your widget configuration in the [app config](/workflow/configuration).

#### Basic widget

An effective way to update a widget is to use the `updateSnapshot` method. This creates a widget timeline with a single entry that displays immediately.

The example below continues from [Creating widget](/versions/latest/sdk/widgets#prerequisite-creating-widget).

```tsx
import MyWidget from './MyWidget';

// Update the widget
MyWidget.updateSnapshot({ count: 5 });
```

#### Timeline widget

Use `updateTimeline` method to schedule widget updates at specific time. System will automatically update the widget based on the timeline.

The example below continues from [Creating widget](/versions/latest/sdk/widgets#prerequisite-creating-widget).

```tsx
import MyWidget from './MyWidget';

MyWidget.updateTimeline([
  { date: new Date(), props: { count: 1 } },
  { date: new Date(Date.now() + 3600000), props: { count: 2 } }, // 1 hour from now
  { date: new Date(Date.now() + 7200000), props: { count: 3 } }, // 2 hours from now
  { date: new Date(Date.now() + 10800000), props: { count: 4 } }, // 3 hours from now
]);
```

#### Responsive widget

Widget component receives a `family` prop indicating which size is being rendered. Use this to adapt layout for different widget sizes.

```tsx
import { HStack, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { createWidget, WidgetBase } from 'expo-widgets';

type WeatherWidgetProps = {
  temperature: number;
  condition: string;
};

const WeatherWidget = (props: WidgetBase<WeatherWidgetProps>) => {
  'widget';
  // Render different layouts based on size
  if (props.family === 'systemSmall') {
    return (
      <VStack>
        <Text>{props.temperature}°</Text>
      </VStack>
    );
  }

  if (props.family === 'systemMedium') {
    return (
      <HStack>
        <Text>{props.temperature}°</Text>
        <Text>{props.condition}</Text>
      </HStack>
    );
  }

  // systemLarge and others
  return (
    <VStack>
      <Text>Temperature: {props.temperature}°</Text>
      <Text>Condition: {props.condition}</Text>
      <Text>Updated: {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}</Text>
    </VStack>
  );
};

const Widget = createWidget('WeatherWidget', WeatherWidget);
export default Widget;

Widget.updateSnapshot({
  temperature: 72,
  condition: 'Sunny',
});
```

### Live Activities

Live Activities display real-time information on the Lock Screen and in the Dynamic Island on supported devices.

#### Prerequisite: Creating Live Activity

Live Activity layouts must be created once using `createLiveActivity` and marked with the `'widget'` directive.

```tsx
import { Image, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { font, foregroundStyle, padding } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';
import { createLiveActivity } from 'expo-widgets';

type DeliveryActivityProps = {
  etaMinutes: number;
  status: string;
};

const DeliveryActivity = (props: DeliveryActivityProps) => {
  'widget';
  return {
    banner: (
      <VStack modifiers={[padding({ all: 12 })]}>
        <Text modifiers={[font({ weight: 'bold' }), foregroundStyle('#007AFF')]}>
          {props.status}
        </Text>
        <Text>Estimated arrival: {props.etaMinutes} minutes</Text>
      </VStack>
    ),
    compactLeading: <Image systemName="box.truck.fill" color="#007AFF" />,
    compactTrailing: <Text>{props.etaMinutes} min</Text>,
    minimal: <Image systemName="box.truck.fill" color="#007AFF" />,
    expandedLeading: (
      <VStack modifiers={[padding({ all: 12 })]}>
        <Image systemName="box.truck.fill" color="#007AFF" />
        <Text modifiers={[font({ size: 12 })]}>Delivering</Text>
      </VStack>
    ),
    expandedTrailing: (
      <VStack modifiers={[padding({ all: 12 })]}>
        <Text modifiers={[font({ weight: 'bold', size: 20 })]}>{props.etaMinutes}</Text>
        <Text modifiers={[font({ size: 12 })]}>minutes</Text>
      </VStack>
    ),
    expandedBottom: (
      <VStack modifiers={[padding({ all: 12 })]}>
        <Text>Driver: John Smith</Text>
        <Text>Order #12345</Text>
      </VStack>
    ),
  };
};

export default createLiveActivity('DeliveryActivity', DeliveryActivity);
```

#### Starting a Live Activity

The example below continues from [Creating Live Activity](/versions/latest/sdk/widgets#prerequisite-creating-live-activity).

```tsx
import { Image, Text, VStack } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui';
import { font, foregroundStyle, padding } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui/modifiers';
import { Button, View } from 'react-native';
import DeliveryActivity from './DeliveryActivity';

function App() {
  const startDeliveryTracking = () => {
    // Start the Live Activity
    const instance = DeliveryActivity.start({
      etaMinutes: 15,
      status: 'Your delivery is on the way',
    });
    // Store instance
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Button title="Start Delivery Tracking" onPress={startDeliveryTracking} />
    </View>
  );
}
export default App;
```

#### Updating a Live Activity

The example below continues from [Starting a Live Activity](/versions/latest/sdk/widgets#starting-a-live-activity).

```tsx
import { LiveActivity } from 'expo-widgets';

function updateDelivery(instance: LiveActivity<DeliveryActivityProps>) {
  instance.update({
    etaMinutes: 2,
    status: 'Delivery arriving soon!',
  });
}
```
